<blockquote>
The following are some of the changes made to improve 
the program execution speed and general runtime performance of 
the Java 2 SDK and Java 2 Runtime Environment. 
Links to relevant bug reports on the BugParade web site are provided 
were applicable for further information.
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Improved Performance for readUTF and writeUTF</b> - The 
implementations of the <tt>readUTF</tt> and <tt>writeUTF</tt> methods 
of <tt>DataInputStream</tt> and <tt>DataInputStream</tt>
have been modified to improve performance. This is a fix for bug number 
<a href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4219771.html">
4219771</a> on the BugParade web site.
<p>
<li><b>Improved Performance of JScrollPane Painting</b> - 
The implementation of JScrollPane has been improved so that it 
does not cause excessive painting and screen flashing when 
double buffering is not used.
<p>
<li><b>Improved JTable Performance</b> - The performance of the 
JTable's column-handling functionality has been improved. 
Previously, the performance of the operations of adding columns 
or recalculating column widths did not scale well as the number 
of columns became large. The implementation has been changed 
to improve scalability.  This is a fix for bug number 
<a href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4223642.html">
4223642</a> on the BugParade web site.
<p>
<li><b>Paint Coalescing</b> - Painting performance has been 
enhanced through the implementation of an improved paint coalescing 
algorithm. Areas 
that require repainting are coalesced into a single, 
non-rectangular repaint area as they are posted to the 
event queue. This has the effect batching repaints, 
executing multiple repaints simultaneously in a manner 
more efficient than in previous releases.  
<p>
<li><b>Frame Resizing</b> - Resizing of top-level frames has been 
improved.
<p>
<li><b>Internal Frame Blitting</b> - By using <tt>Graphics.copyArea</tt> 
calls, Swing's DefaultDesktopManager now needs to redraw far 
less when frames are dragged.
<p>
<li><b>Performance Enhancements in <tt>BigIntenger</tt></b> -
Class <tt>java.math.BigInteger</tt> has been reimplemented in pure 
Java programming-language code.  Previously, <tt>BigInteger</tt>'s 
implementation was based on the Plumb C library.  The new 
implementation performs all standard operations much faster 
than the old implementation. The speed-up realized in the new 
implemenation can be as much as 5x or more, depending on the 
operation being performed.

<p>
<li><b>Provision for Better-Performing Numeric Operations</b></a> - The 
Java 2 Platform now contains two classes which provide API for 
performing general numeric operations.  
<ul>
   <li><tt><a href=../../api/java/lang/StrictMath.html>java.lang.StrictMath</a></tt> - Class <tt>java.lang.StrictMath</tt> is a renaming of class 
<tt>java.lang.Math</tt> from previous versions of the Java platform, 
but otherwise retains the previous specification of <tt>Math</tt>. 
In particular, it is defined to return bit-for-bit reproducible 
results in all implementations.
   <li><tt><a href=../../api/java/lang/Math.html>java.lang.Math</a></tt> - 
Class <tt>java.lang.Math</tt> provides the same set of API as does 
class <tt>StrictMath</tt>. However, unlike some of the numeric functions of 
class <tt>StrictMath</tt>, all implementations of the equivalent functions 
of class <tt>Math</tt> are not defined to return the bit-for-bit same results, 
but can vary within specified constraints. 
This relaxation permits better-performing implementations where strict
reproducibility is not required.
</ul>
</ul>
