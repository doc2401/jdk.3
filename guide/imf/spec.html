<H2><A NAME="Framework Architecture"></A>1. Framework Architecture
</H2>

<P>The following picture shows the overall structure of the framework
and its clients. Parts outlined in bold are integrated with the input
method framework as part of the Java 2 platform; others can be
developed and distributed separately by independent software vendors.
</P>

<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="framework.gif" WIDTH=382 HEIGHT=204
ALIGN=bottom></CENTER></P>

<P>The input method client API defines the classes and interfaces
that text editing components can use to implement an integrated text
input user interface. The AWT text components <CODE>TextArea</CODE>
and <CODE>TextField</CODE> provide on-the-spot or over-the-spot
composition, depending on implementation. The text components of the
Swing user interface toolkit provide an integrated text input user
interface. The context management manages communication paths between
the text editing components and input methods. The input method
engine SPI defines the interfaces that allow input method engines and
adapters to be plugged into the framework. Input method engines can
be implemented directly in the Java programming language using these
interfaces. To use native input methods integrated with the host
input method manager, an adapter translates information between the
data models used by native input methods and the input method
framework and provides the composition window. Adapters for other
input systems, such as Java Speech or the Internet-Intranet Input
Method Protocol (IIIMP), can also be implemented using this
interface.</P>

<H2><A NAME="Client Components"></A>2. Client Components</H2>

<P>Every instance of the <CODE>Component</CODE> class is potentially
a client of the input method framework. The framework distinguishes
between four kinds of components:</P>

<UL>
   <LI><EM>Active clients</EM> are components whose
   <CODE><A HREF="../../api/java/awt/Component.html#getInputMethodRequests()">getInputMethodRequests</A></CODE>
   implementations return a non-null value. The framework assumes
   that these components actively use the input method client API
   and, in particular, provide an implementation of the
   <CODE><A HREF="../../api/java/awt/event/InputMethodListener.html">InputMethodListener</A></CODE>
   interface. These components are expected to handle events and
   requests for information coming from the input method and draw
   composed text that is sent to them.
   
   <LI><EM>Non-clients</EM> are components that have turned off input
   method support using the
   <CODE><A HREF="../../api/java/awt/Component.html#enableInputMethods(boolean)">enableInputMethods</A></CODE>
   method.
   
   <LI><EM>Peered clients</EM> are peered text components (instances
   of the <CODE>TextComponent</CODE> class). Their behavior is
   implementation dependent, and their input method support may be
   limited. In Sun's Java 2 runtime environment for Windows, peered
   text components behave mostly like active clients. In Sun's Java 2
   runtime environment for Solaris, peered text components can
   receive input only from host input methods, and they do not
   support the below-the-spot input style (see below).
   
   <LI><EM>Passive clients</EM> are all remaining components. The
   framework assumes that passive clients don't use the input method
   client API, but still need to receive text input from input
   methods.
</UL>

<P>All four kinds of components may coexist in the same window. The
input method framework, therefore, needs to determine the
capabilities of components and adjust its behavior as the focus moves
from one component to another.</P>

<P>Client components are not responsible for drawing candidate lists
or for user interface elements that control the input method's
behavior. Depending on the platform, this responsibility rests with
input methods, the host input method manager, or the input method
framework.</P>

<P>Input methods are not concerned with the differences between
client components. They interact with them indirectly through the
input method framework, which presents an interface similar to an
active client and handles the differences internally.</P>

<P>
<HR>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="Input Styles"></A>3. Input Styles</H2>

<P>The input method framework supports three input styles:</P>

<UL>
   <LI><EM>On-the-spot</EM> input, where the client component draws
   the composed text in the context of the document that it will
   eventually belong to, but in a style that indicates that the text
   still needs to be converted or confirmed by the input method. This
   is the default input style for active clients.
   
   <LI><EM>Below-the-spot</EM> input, where the composed text is
   shown in a separate composition window that is automatically
   positioned just below the insertion point where text will be
   inserted after being committed. The window's location is
   calculated first when the window is opened, then updated whenever
   committed text has been dispatched to the client component. If
   positioning the window below the insertion point would move it
   partially or entirely off-screen, it is moved above the insertion
   point. This input style may be selected for active clients as
   described below.
   
   <LI><EM>Root-window</EM> input, where the composed text is shown
   in a separate composition window that is not automatically
   positioned. This input style is used for passive clients.
</UL>

<P>The framework chooses between on-the-spot and below-the-spot input
for active clients based on a system property or an AWT property
"java.awt.im.style". The system property can be defined from the
command line (by the end user), the AWT property in a localized
awt.properties file (by the localizer or a system administrator). If
both are defined, the system property takes precedence. If the
property's value is "below-the-spot", below-the-spot input is used,
otherwise on-the-spot input.</P>

<P>Support for below-the-spot input with native input methods is
platform dependent. In Sun's Java 2 runtime environments, it is
supported on Windows, but not on Solaris. Where it is not supported,
on-the-spot input is used instead.</P>

<P>The input style used for peered text components (instances of the
<CODE>TextComponent</CODE> class) is implementation dependent and may
not be any of the styles described above. In Sun's Java 2 runtime
environment for Windows, below-the-spot input may be selected as
described above, otherwise over-the-spot input is used, where
composed text is drawn in a separate window covering the insertion
point. In Sun's Java 2 runtime environment for Solaris, the input
style depends on the input method.</P>

<P>No input style is associated with non-clients.</P>

<P>Input methods are not concerned with the differences between input
styles. They interact with client components indirectly through the
input method framework, which presents an interface assuming
on-the-spot input and handles the differences internally.</P>

<P>
<HR>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="Input Method Engines and Adapters"></A>4. Input Method
Engines and Adapters</H2>

<P>The input method engine SPI enables the development of input
methods in the Java programming language. Adapters for other input
systems, such as Java Speech or the Internet-Intranet Input Method
Protocol, can also be implemented using this interface. For
information specific to the SPI, see the
<A HREF="../../api/java/awt/im/spi/package-summary.html#package_specification">SPI
package specification</A>.</P>

<P>The SPI is also used for host input method adapters, which connect
to native input methods integrated with the host input method
managers, such as the Input Method Manager on Win32, the Text
Services Manager on MacOS, and XIM on Solaris. The host input method
adapter plays the role of an input method within the input method
framework, and translates events and requests between the data models
used by AWT and the input method framework on one side and the host's
input method manager on the other side. It also cooperates with the
input context in managing the composition window - for passive
clients interacting host input methods, typically the root window
provided by the host input method manager is used. The adapter passes
on requests for particular input methods to the host, but users can
also use the host's selection mechanism to select input methods.</P>

<P>
<HR>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="Context Management"></A>5. Context Management</H2>

<P><CODE>InputContext</CODE> instances manage communication contexts
between client components and input methods. The main task of an
input context is to maintain the connection from the current client
component to its current input method. It dispatches input events
such as key and mouse events from the component to the current input
method, and input method events from the input method to the client
component. It also dispatches requests for information from the input
method to the client component.</P>

<P>Each <CODE>InputContext</CODE> instance provides its own text
input environment, separate from all other input contexts. This
allows applications to support multiple concurrent input operations.
For example, in the middle of entering text into a document, a user
can open a file dialog and enter a file name, without affecting the
composition state of the text being entered into the document.</P>

<P>By default, one <CODE>InputContext</CODE> instance is created per
Window instance, and this input context is shared by all components
within the window's containment hierarchy. If necessary, components
can create private input contexts. A component that doesn't have its
own input context uses the one used by its parent. An input context
has at most one current client component, the component that
currently has the focus. When switching to a new client component,
the input context calls its
<CODE><A HREF="../../api/java/awt/im/InputContext.html#endComposition()">endComposition</A></CODE>
method to commit or cancel composed text for the previous client
component.</P>

<P>The input context creates an input method instance for each input
method engine that its client components need to use. Separate input
method instances are created for each input context instance. The
instances are kept until the input context is disposed, so that the
instances can keep information about the text that was entered in the
window.</P>

<P>The input context also handles input method selection and the
composition window.</P>

<H4><A NAME="Selecting Input Methods"></A>Selecting Input Methods
</H4>

<P>An input context has a current input method and a current locale.
</P>

<P>The input method framework provides two separate ways of selecting
input methods and input locales:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>The method
   <CODE><A HREF="../../api/java/awt/im/InputContext.html#selectInputMethod(java.util.Locale)">InputContext.selectInputMethod</A></CODE>
   lets applications request an input method supporting a specified
   locale.
   
   <LI>A user interface lets the user request an input method by
   name, and specify the input locale. A selection made from the user
   interface affects the currently active input context only.
</UL>

<P>The framework does not give preference to selections made either
way, so the last successful selection made either way for an input
context determines the current input method for an input context
(note that <CODE>selectInputMethod</CODE> may fail if no available
input method supports the requested locale).</P>

<P>Before switching to a new input method, the input context calls
the old input method's <CODE>endComposition</CODE> method. The input
context retains the old input method instance and reuses it when the
same input method is selected again for this input context at a later
point.</P>

<P><CODE>InputContext.selectInputMethod</CODE> looks for an input
method supporting the specified locale using the results of the
<CODE>InputMethodDescriptor.getAvailableLocales</CODE> methods of all
installed input methods. If the user has previously selected an input
method with the specified locale from the user interface, this input
method is chosen. Otherwise it is implementation dependent which
input method is chosen if multiple input methods support the
specified locale.</P>

<P>The user interface for selecting input methods is implementation
dependent. It must provide the user with a list of all available
input methods and let him/her select one of them. Where an input
method supports multiple locales, the user interface also lets the
user select the input locale (this facility may be omitted for host
adapters if the host provides an alternative facility to select the
input locale). Licensees developing Java runtime environments for
their own platforms are encouraged to integrate the user interface
with existing user interfaces for selecting keyboards or input
methods.</P>

<P>In Sun's Java 2 runtime environments for Windows and Solaris, the
user interface consists of two parts: a "Select Input Method" menu
item added to the Window menu in Motif or the System menu in Windows,
and a pop-up menu brought up by this new menu item. The "Select Input
Method" item is only shown if the Java runtime environment has more
than one input method available or the input method supports multiple
locales (the host input method adapter is treated as a single input
method). The popup menu lists the available input methods, with
supported locales of multi-locale input methods as submenus, and lets
the user select from this list.</P>

<H4><A NAME="Composition Window"></A>Composition Window</H4>

<P>For passive clients and for active clients using below-the-spot
input, the input method framework provides a composition window. The
window is opened when the input method starts sending composed text;
it is closed when all text is committed. At most one composition
window is open at any time even if multiple compositions (using
separate input contexts) are currently in progress.</P>

<P>For below-the-spot input, the window is automatically positioned
just below the insertion point where text will be inserted after
being committed. The window's location is calculated first when the
window is opened, then updated whenever committed text has been
dispatched to the client component. If positioning the window below
the insertion point would move it partially or entirely off-screen,
it is moved above the insertion point.</P>

<P>
<HR>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="Information Flow Through the Framework"></A>6.
Information Flow Through the Framework</H2>

<P>The framework provides two mechanisms to communicate information
between the current client component and the current input method:
</P>

<UL>
   <LI>AWT events are used to pass information about user actions to
   the input method, and to notify the component of changes in the
   input text. This provides a programming interface that's
   consistent with other input operations. However,
   <CODE>InputMethodEvents</CODE> are typically dispatched
   synchronously to the component's methods, while other AWT events
   are dispatched asynchronously through the event queue.
   
   <LI>The <CODE>InputMethodRequests</CODE> interface defines methods
   that an input method can call to request information from the
   client component. This invocation is synchronous.
</UL>

<P>Both event dispatching and calling
<CODE>InputMethodRequests</CODE> methods are done indirectly through
the input context. This lets the input context redirect information
to a composition window if necessary. The composition window provides
a full implementation of an active client, and so the input method
can always assume it is interacting with an active client.</P>

<P>The following sections show the flow of events through the input
method framework and explain the associated handling of input method
requests. Four alternatives are described, depending on the kind of
client component and the selected input style. All diagrams assume an
input method implemented in the Java programming language using the
input method engine SPI. Event flows for peered text components or
native input methods are implementation dependent, may vary
substantially, and are not shown.</P>

<H4>Active Clients With On-the-Spot Input</H4>

<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="eventflow-active-ots.gif" WIDTH=427 HEIGHT=247
ALIGN=bottom></CENTER></P>

<P>Input events such as <CODE>KeyEvent</CODE> and
<CODE>MouseEvent</CODE> are sent to the current input method through
the <CODE>InputContext</CODE> object. If the input method uses the
event for text composition, it marks the event consumed and generates
an input method event to the component. The client component must
have registered an <CODE>InputMethodListener</CODE> so it can handle
<CODE>InputMethodEvent</CODE>s coming from the input method and
receive composed and committed text.</P>

<P><CODE>InputMethodRequests</CODE> calls from the input method are
forwarded to the object returned by the client component's
<CODE><A HREF="../../api/java/awt/Component.html#getInputMethodRequests()">getInputMethodRequests</A></CODE>
method.</P>

<H4>Active Clients With Below-the-Spot Input</H4>

<H4><CENTER><IMG SRC="eventflow-active-bts.gif" WIDTH=427 HEIGHT=247
ALIGN=bottom></CENTER></H4>

<P>Input events such as <CODE>KeyEvent</CODE> and
<CODE>MouseEvent</CODE> are sent to the current input method through
the <CODE>InputContext</CODE> object. If the input method uses the
event for text composition, it marks the event consumed and generates
an input method event. Since below-the-spot input is selected, the
event is redirected to the composition window, which handles it. When
text is committed (partially or entirely), the composition window
generates a new input method event holding the committed text for the
client component. The client component must have registered an
<CODE>InputMethodListener</CODE> so it can handle
<CODE>InputMethodEvent</CODE>s, which in this case come from the
composition window and only contain committed text.</P>

<P><CODE>InputMethodRequests</CODE> calls from the input method that
relate to the display of composed text (<CODE>getTextLocation</CODE>,
<CODE>getLocationOffset</CODE>) are handled by the composition
window; all others are forwarded to the object returned by the client
component's
<CODE><A HREF="../../api/java/awt/Component.html#getInputMethodRequests()">getInputMethodRequests</A></CODE>
method. The composition window uses the client component's
<CODE>getTextLocation</CODE> implementation to position itself.</P>

<H4>Passive Clients</H4>

<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="eventflow-passive.gif" WIDTH=427 HEIGHT=247
ALIGN=bottom></CENTER></P>

<P>Input events such as <CODE>KeyEvent</CODE> and
<CODE>MouseEvent</CODE> are sent to the current input method through
the <CODE>InputContext</CODE> object. If the input method uses the
event for text composition, it marks the event consumed and generates
an input method event. The event is redirected to the composition
window, which handles it. When text is committed, the composition
window translates it into key events for the actual client's key
event listener. Only KEY_TYPED events are sent.</P>

<P><CODE>InputMethodRequests</CODE> calls from the input method are
handled by the composition window. Calls hat relate to the display of
composed text (<CODE>getTextLocation</CODE>,
<CODE>getLocationOffset</CODE>) are handled based on information
about the composed text being displayed. All other calls are handled
at all times based on the assumption that composition has just
started and there's no committed text, because the composition window
does not have access to text in the client component.</P>

<H4>Non-Clients</H4>

<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="eventflow-non.gif" WIDTH=427 HEIGHT=67
ALIGN=bottom></CENTER></P>

<P>Events for non-clients do not go to the input context. All events
go straight to the component's listeners (here, the key listener).
