<h3>Physical Fonts and Logical Fonts</h3></a>
<blockquote>
There are two types of fonts -- <em>physical</em> fonts and 
<em>logical</em> fonts.  Physical fonts are the actual font 
libraries consisting of, for example, TrueType or PostScript 
Type 1 fonts.  The physical fonts may be Time, Helvetica, 
Courier, or any number of other fonts, including 
international fonts.  For more information, see 
<a href=physicalfont.html><b>Physical Fonts</b></a>.
<p>
Logical fonts are the five font types that have been recognized 
by the Java platform since version 1.0: Serif, Sans-serif, 
Monospaced, Dialog, and DialogInput. These logical fonts are 
not actual font libraries that are installed anywhere on your 
system.  They are merely font-type names recognized 
by the Java runtime which must be mapped to some physical 
font that is installed on your system.  In addition to the 
five logical font types, the Java runtime recognizes four 
logical font styles: plain, bold, italic, and bolditalic.
</blockquote>
<a name=props>
<h3>The font.properties Files</h3></a>
<blockquote>
The mapping of logical font types (and styles) to physical fonts 
is handled by the font.properties files. The font.properties files 
are located in the <tt>jre/lib</tt> directory of the Java 2 SDK 
or the <tt>lib</tt> directory of the Java 2 Runtime Environment. 
Because the physical fonts available will depend on the 
operating system and the locale, the SDK and Runtime Environments 
come with a variety of font.properties files for different 
locales and (in the case of the Solaris operating system) for 
different operating system versions.
<p>
When an application or applet wants to invoke a font by using 
a logical name such as Serif or Monospace, the runtime environment 
looks up in the font.properties file the physical font that is 
mapped to that logical name and then loads and uses that physical 
font. For example, on both Solaris 2.6/2.7 and Microsoft Windows 
operating systems, the font.properties file maps the 
Serif logical font to the Times New Roman physical font.  This 
means that the following two constructors would create the same 
font:
<blockquote><pre>
new Font("Serif", Font.PLAIN, 12)  // Logical font name is mapped 
                                   // to Times New Roman by 
                                   // font.properties file

new Font("Times New Roman", Font.PLAIN, 12) // Physical font is 
                                            // invoked directly; 
                                            // no need for mapping
</pre></blockquote>
Here we see that the first (String) parameter in the Font constructor 
can be either a logical font type or the family 
name of a physical font.  Available font family names may be obtained 
by using the <a href="../../api/java/awt/GraphicsEnvironment.html#getAvailableFontFamily
Names()"><code>getAvailableFontFamilyNames</code></a> method of 
class <tt>java.awt.Graphdics Environment</tt>. 
</blockquote>

<a name=location>
<h3>Location of Physical Fonts</h3></a>
<blockquote>
Physical font files can be installed in either an operating system's 
standard location for fonts or in the <tt>jre/lib/fonts</tt> library 
of the Java 2 SDK (or in the <tt>lib/fonts</tt> directory of the 
Java 2 Runtime Environment).  Fonts in either the operating system's 
standard location or in the <tt>lib/font</tt> directory will be 
on the Java runtime's "font path" and can be used by applications 
and applets. 
</blockquote>

<a name=adding>
<h3>Adding Fonts</h3></a>
<blockquote>
The following TrueType fonts come already installed in the Java 2 
SDK's <tt>jre/lib/font</tt> directory.
<blockquote><pre>
LucidaBrightDemiBold.ttf
LucidaBrightDemiItalic.ttf
LucidaBrightItalic.ttf
LucidaBrightRegular.ttf
LucidaSansDemiBold.ttf
LucidaSansDemiOblique.ttf
LucidaSansOblique.ttf
LucidaSansRegular.ttf
LucidaTypewriterBold.ttf
LucidaTypewriterBoldOblique.ttf
LucidaTypewriterOblique.ttf
LucidaTypewriterRegular.ttf
</pre></blockquote>

In addition, many are fonts pre-installed on Microsoft Windows and 
Solaris operating systems.  Other fonts can be easily added.  
The additional fonts may be installed by the operating system so 
that they are placed in the operating system's standard font location. 
For example, Asian fonts are available for Win32 systems from 
Microsoft's web site and on the Windows NT 4.0 installation CD-ROM.  
The Win32 operating systems will install these fonts in the 
standard location for fonts.  These fonts can then be found by the 
Java runtime.
<p>
Another option for installing fonts is for the user to place the 
fonts directory in the SDK's <tt>jre/lib/font</tt> directory 
(or the Runtime Environment's <tt>lib/font</tt> directory).  Fonts 
located there will also be found by the Java runtime.  
Files placed in <tt>jre/lib/font</tt> directory must be Unicode 
encoded TrueType fonts.
<p>
It is not necessary to edit the font.properties files after 
you have added new fonts to your system.  You can invoke the 
new font directly by using its font family name. 
You would need to edit the font.properties files only in the 
situation in which you wanted to map one of the logical 
font types (Serif, Sans-serif, Monospace, Dialog, and 
DialogInput) to a new font, or if you want to make some locale-specific 
mapping.  For information on editing the font.proprerties files, see
