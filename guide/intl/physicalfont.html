<h1>Physical Fonts</h1>
</center>

<hr>
<p>
Starting with the 1.2 release, the Java 2 SDK
includes a set of TrueType fonts in the <code>lib/fonts</code> subdirectory.
Prior to the 1.2 release, the JDK software
relied on the host platform fonts.
Logical fonts, such as Monospaced,
are mapped to the host platform fonts
in the <code>font.properties</code> file.
To distinguish them from the logical fonts,
this document refers to the TrueType fonts
as <em>physical fonts</em>. 

<h2> Benefits </h2>

Because physical fonts are included in the Java 2 Platform itself, 
programmers are guaranteed to have a uniform set of font families 
available for several locales for use on whatever host platform the 
Java runtime environment is on.  This obviously lessens programmer's 
dependence on the fonts might be provided by the host platform, which 
can vary greatly from platform to platform, and from locale to locale.
<p>

The SDK's physical fonts offer the following benefits:
<ul>
<li>Consistent Look and Feel
<p>
Your applications will look the same on all platforms
because they will be using the same fonts.  
This makes testing,
deployment, and support easier in a cross-platform environment.
<p>
<li> Rich Character Sets
<p>
You don't have to switch fonts if you use
characters from various scripts.
For example, in a text component that uses the
Lucida Sans Regular font, you can display
characters in Hebrew, Arabic, German, and English, which are 
all included as part of the SDK's Lucida Sans Regular font.
(Asian character sets for the physical fonts are not supported in the current
release.)
<p>
<li> Euro Currency Symbol
<p>
All of the physical fonts of the Java 2 Platform
support the Euro currency symbol.
</ul>

<h2> The Physical Fonts Supplied by the Java 2 Platform </h2>

The Java 2 SDK provides three font families: Lucida Sans, Lucida Bright, and 
Lucida Sans Typewriter. Each family contains four fonts, for a total of 
12 fonts:

<ul>
<li>Lucida Sans Regular 
<li>Lucida Sans Bold     
<li>Lucida Sans Oblique  
<li>Lucida Sans Bold Oblique 
</ul>

<p> </p>

<ul>
<li>Lucida Bright Regular 
<li>Lucida Bright Bold
<li>Lucida Bright Italic
<li>Lucida Bright Bold Italic
</ul>

<p> </p>

<ul>
<li>Lucida Sans Typewriter Regular 
<li>Lucida Sans Typewriter Bold
<li>Lucida Sans Typewriter Oblique
<li>Lucida Sans Typewriter Bold Oblique
</ul>

<h2> Related Methods in the Java 2D<sup><font size=-1>TM</font></sup> API</h2>
<ul>
<li> <a href="../../api/java/awt/GraphicsEnvironment.html#getAvailableFontFamilyNames()"><code>GraphicsEnvironment.getAvailableFontFamilyNames</code></a>  
<p>
Returns an array of font family names available for use, including 
font families provided by the host platform as well as the families 
provided by the SDK.
<p>
<li> <a href="../../api/java/awt/GraphicsEnvironment.html#getAllFonts()"><code>GraphicsEnvironment.getAllFonts</code></a>
<p>
Returns an array of physical fonts 
in this environment.  The fonts returned include 
the fonts supplied by the host platform and the
physical fonts of the SDK.
</ul>

<h2>Using the SDK's Physical Fonts</h2>
You can use the physical fonts in the SDK in the same way that you'd 
use any other fonts such as those supplied by the underlying platform. 
For example, you can create an instance of the Lucida Sans Regular font 
with the usual <code>Font</code> constructor. For example, this 
constructor would create a <code>Font</code> instance for the 
Lucida Sans Regular font.
<blockquote><pre>
Font f = new Font("Lucida Sans", font.PLAIN, 12)
</pre></blockquote>

The following example would create a <code>Font</code> instance for 
the Lucida Sans Typewriter Oblique font.
<blockquote><pre>
Font f = new Font("Lucida Sans Typewriter", font.ITALIC, 18)
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The Java 2 Platform's physical fonts are located in the 
<code>jre/lib/fonts</code> folder in the Java 2 SDK and in 
the <code>lib/fonts</code> directory of the Java 2 Runtime 
Environment.  Users can add additional TrueType fonts to 
this directory for use by their programs. The TrueType fonts 
must be Unicode encoded.
