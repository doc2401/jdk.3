<blockquote>
<h3>Emitting Client and Server Bindings</h3>
To generate Java bindings for an IDL file named My.idl:

<UL><TT>idlj My.idl</TT></UL>

This generates the client-side bindings and is equivalent to:

<UL><TT>idlj <B>-fclient</B> My.idl</TT></UL>

The client-side bindings do not include the server-side
skeleton. If you want to generate the server-side bindings
for the interfaces:

<UL><TT>idlj <B>-fserver</B> My.idl</TT></UL>

Server-side bindings include the client-side bindings plus the skeleton,
all of which are <code>ImplBase</code> (that is, Inheritance model)
classes. If you want to generate both client side and server side
bindings, use one of the following (equivalent) commands:

<UL>
<TT>idlj <B>-fclient -fserver</B> My.idl</TT>
<BR>
<TT>idlj <B>-fall</B> My.idl</TT></UL>

The default server-side model is the inheritance model. Given an interface
<tt>My</tt> defined in <tt>My.idl</tt>, the file <tt>_MyImplBase.java</tt>
is generated. You must provide the implementation for <tt>My</tt> and it
must inherit from <tt>_MyImplBase</tt>.

<P>There is another server-side model called the Tie Model. This
is a delegation model. The following commands generate the bindings
for the Tie Model:

<UL><TT>idlj <B>-fserverTIE</B> My.idl</TT>
<BR><TT>idlj <B>-fallTIE</B> My.idl</TT></UL>

For the interface <tt>My</tt>, this will generate <tt>My_Tie.java</tt>. The
constructor to <tt>My_Tie</tt> takes a <tt>My</tt>. You must provide
the implementation for <tt>My</tt>, but it does not have to inherit
from any other class, only the interface <tt>My</tt>. But to use it
with the ORB, you must wrap your implementation within <tt>My_Tie</tt>.
For instance:

<UL><TT>MyImpl myImpl = new MyImpl ();</TT>
<BR><TT>My_Tie tie = new My_Tie (myImpl);</TT>
<BR><TT>orb.connect (tie);</TT></UL>

You might want to use the Tie model instead of the typical
Inheritance model if your implementation must inherit from some other
implementation. Java allows any number of interface inheritance, but
there is only one slot for class inheritance. If you use the inheritance
model, that slot is used up . By using the Tie Model, that slot is freed
up for your own use. The drawback is that it introduces a level of
indirection: one extra method call occurs when invoking a method.

<h3>Specifying Alternate Locations for Emitted Files</h3>
If you want to direct the emitted files to a directory other than the current
directory, invoke the compiler as:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>idlj <b>-td /altdir</b> My.idl</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

For the interface <tt>My</tt>, the bindings will be emitted to
<tt>/altdir/My.java</tt>, etc., instead of <tt>./My.java</tt>.

<h3>Specifying Alternate Locations for Include Files</h3>

If <tt>My.idl</tt> included another idl file, <tt>MyOther.idl</tt>,
the compiler assumes that <tt>MyOther.idl</tt> resides in the local
directory. If it resides in <tt>/includes</tt>, for example, then you
would invoke the compiler with the following command:

<UL>
<TT>idlj <B>-i /includes</B> My.idl</TT>
</UL>

If <tt>My.idl</tt> also included <tt>Another.idl</tt> that resided
in <tt>/moreIncludes</tt>, for example, then you would invoke the
compiler with the following command:

<UL><TT>
idlj <B>-i /includes -i /moreIncludes</B> My.idl
</TT></UL>

Since this form of include can become irritatingly long,
another means of indicating to the compiler where to search
for included files is provided. This technique is similar to the idea of
an environment variable. Create a file named
<tt>idl.config</tt> in a directory that is listed in your CLASSPATH.
Inside of <tt>idl.config</tt>, provide a line with the
following form:

<UL><TT>includes=/includes;/moreIncludes</TT></UL>

The compiler will find this file and read in the includes list. Note
that in this example the separator character between the two directories
is a semicolon (;). This separator character is platform dependent.
On NT it is a semicolon, on AIX it is a colon, etc.

<h3>Emitting Bindings for Include Files</h3>

By default, only those interfaces, structs, etc, that are defined in the
idl file on the command line have Java bindings generated for them.
The types defined in included files are not generated. For example,
assume the following two idl files:

<UL>
<HR ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE WIDTH="18%">
<B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>My.idl</FONT></I></B></UL>
<UL><TT>#include &lt;MyOther.idl></TT>
<BR><TT>interface My</TT>
<BR><TT>{</TT>
<BR><TT>};</TT>
<BR>

<HR ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE WIDTH="20%">
<B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>MyOther.idl</FONT></I></B>
<P><TT>interface MyOther</TT>
<BR><TT>{</TT>
<BR><TT>};</TT>&nbsp;
<HR ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE WIDTH="20%">
</UL>

The following command will only generate the java bindings for <tt>My</tt>:

<UL><TT>idlj My.idl</TT></UL>

To generate all of the types in <tt>My.idl</tt> and all of the
types in the files that <tt>My.idl</tt> includes
(in this example, <tt>MyOther.idl</tt>), use the following command:

<UL><TT>
idlj <B>-emitAll</B> My.idl
</TT></UL>

There is a caveat to the default rule. <tt>#include</tt> statements which
appear at global scope are treated as described. These <tt>#include</tt>
statements can be thought of as import statements. <tt>#include</tt>
statements which appear within some enclosing scope are treated as
true <tt>#include</tt> statements, meaning that the code within
the included file is treated as if it appeared in the original file
and, therefore, Java bindings are emitted for it.
Here is an example:

<UL>
<HR ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE WIDTH="20%">
<B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>My.idl</FONT></I></B></UL>
<UL><TT>#include &lt;MyOther.idl></TT>
<BR><TT>interface My</TT>
<BR><TT>{</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp; #include &lt;Embedded.idl></TT>
<BR><TT>};&nbsp;

<HR ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE WIDTH="20%"></TT>
<B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>MyOther.idl</FONT></I></B>
</UL>
<UL><TT>interface MyOther</TT>
<BR><TT>{</TT>
<BR><TT>};&nbsp;
<HR ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE WIDTH="20%">
</TT><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>Embedded.idl</FONT></I></B></UL>

<UL><TT>enum E {one, two, three};</TT>&nbsp;
<HR ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE WIDTH="20%">
</UL>

Running the following command:

<UL><TT>idlj My.idl</TT></UL>

will generate the following list of Java files:

<UL>
<TT>./MyHolder.java</TT>
<BR><TT>./MyHelper.java</TT>
<BR><TT>./_MyStub.java</TT>
<BR><TT>./MyPackage</TT>
<BR><TT>./MyPackage/EHolder.java</TT>
<BR><TT>./MyPackage/EHelper.java</TT>
<BR><TT>./MyPackage/E.java</TT>
<BR><TT>./My.java</TT>
</UL>

Notice that <tt>MyOther.java</tt> was not generated because it is
defined in an import-like <tt>#include</tt>. But <tt>E.java</tt>
<I>was</I> generated because it was defined in a true <tt>#include</tt>.
Also notice that since <tt>Embedded.idl</tt> was included within
the scope of the interface <tt>My</tt>, it appears within the
scope of <tt>My</tt> (that is,in <tt>MyPackage</tt>).

<P>If the <i>-emitAll</i> flag had been used in the previous example, then
all types in all included files would be emitted.

<h3>Inserting Package Prefixes</h3>
Suppose that you work for a company named ABC that has constructed
the following IDL file:
<UL>
<HR ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE WIDTH="20%">
<BR><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>Widgets.idl</FONT></I></B>

<P><TT>module Widgets</TT>
<BR><TT>{</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp; interface W1 {...};</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp; interface W2 {...};</TT>
<BR><TT>};</TT>&nbsp;
<HR ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE WIDTH="20%">
</UL>

Running this file through the IDL-to-Java compiler will place the Java
bindings for <tt>W1</tt> and <tt>W2</tt> within the package
<tt>Widgets</tt>. But there is an industry convention that states
that a company's packages should reside within a package named
<tt>com.&lt;company name&gt;</tt>. The <tt>Widgets</tt> package
is not good enough. To follow convention, it should be
<tt>com.abc.Widgets</tt>. To place this package prefix onto the
<tt>Widgets</tt> module, execute the following:

<UL><TT>
idlj <B>-pkgPrefix Widgets com.abc</B> Widgets.idl
</TT></UL>

If you have an IDL file which includes <tt>Widgets.idl</tt>,
the <i>-pkgPrefix</i> flag must appear in that command also. If it does
not, then your IDL file will be looking for a <tt>Widgets</tt> package
rather than a <tt>com.abc.Widgets</tt> package.

<P>If you have a number of these packages that require prefixes, it might
be easier to place them into the <tt>idl.config</tt> file
described above. Each package prefix line should be of the form:

<UL><TT>
PkgPrefix.&lt;type>=&lt;prefix>
</TT></UL>

So the line for the above example would be:

<UL><TT>
PkgPrefix.Widgets=com.abc
</TT></UL>

<h3>Defining Symbols Before Compilation</h3>
You may need to define a symbol for compilation that is not defined
within the IDL file, perhaps to include debugging code in the bindings.
The command

<UL><TT>
idlj <B>-d</B> MYDEF My.idl
</TT></UL>

is the equivalent of putting the line <tt>#define MYDEF</tt>
inside <tt>My.idl</tt>.

<h3>Preserving Pre-Existing Bindings</h3>
If the Java binding files already exist, the <i>-keep</i> flag
will keep the compiler from overwriting them. The default is to
generate all files without
considering if they already exist. If you've customized those files
(which you should not do unless you are very comfortable with their contents),
then the <i>-keep</i> option is very useful. The command

<UL><TT>
idlj <B>-keep</B> My.idl
</TT></UL>

emit all client-side bindings that do not already exist.

<h3>Viewing Progres of Compilation</h3>
The Idl-to-Java compiler will generate status messages as it progresses
through its phases of execution. Use the <tt>-v</tt> option to activate this
"verbose" mode:

<UL><TT>idlj <B>-v</B> My.idl</TT></UL>

By default the compiler does not operate in verbose mode.

<h3>Displaying Version Information</h3>
<P>To display the build version of the IDL-to-Java compiler, specify the
<i>-version</i> option on the command-line:

<P><TT>idlj -version</TT>

<P>Version information also appears within the bindings generated by the
compiler. Any additional options appearing on the command-line
are ignored.

<H2>Restrictions:</H2>
<ul><lh><li>
Escaped identifiers in the global scope may not have the same spelling
as IDL primitive types, <tt>Object</tt>, or <tt>ValueBase</tt>. This is
because the symbol table is pre-loaded with these identifiers; allowing
them to be redefined would overwrite their original definitions. (Possible
permanent restriction).</li>

<li>
No local stubs, and no copy semantics when passing values locally (awaiting
POA implementation).</li>

<li>
The <tt>fixed</tt> IDL type is not supported.</li>

<li>
The generated stubs do not support Serialization, due to IDL/Java mapping
specification 1998-08-22 section 25.3.1.3 failing to specify what's required.</li>

<li>
Constants of type <tt>octet</tt> cannot be declared.</li>
</ul>

<H2>Known Problems:</H2>
<ul><lh>
<li>
The Java bindings for IDL valuetypes produced by the IDL compiler are not
fully compliant with the latest OMG revision of the Objects By Value specification.&nbsp;
Fully compliant bindings will be supported in a future release of the compiler.</li>

<li>
In some cases, the Java class generated by the compiler from an IDL valuetype
definition may not contain a no-argument constructor. If this occurs, edit
the generated code to add an empty public or protected no-argument constructor.</li>

<li>
The compiler may complete the compilation process without errors but fail
to generate output.&nbsp; If this happens, specify the <font face="Courier New,Courier">-emitAll</font>
option.</li>

<li>
The compiler does not recognize the deprecated CORBA::Principal type.</li>

<li>
Declaration of a constant and method or attribute having the same name
in the same scope does not cause an error. The following IDL should cause
an error but doesn't:</li>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interface t {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; const long foo = 1;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; attribute long foo;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; };</pre>

<li>
The following IDL results in an error for "S is an undeclared type" in
interface B. It shouldn't.</li>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interface A { struct S { short s; }; };
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interface B:A { typedef S new_S;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; exception ex {S f1;}; // Error for "S" here
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; };</pre>

<li>
If a <tt>union</tt> defines another <tt>union</tt> in its default clause,
the resulting Java class gets compilation errors. The work-around is to
define the <tt>nested union</tt> outside of the containing <tt>union</tt>.</li>
