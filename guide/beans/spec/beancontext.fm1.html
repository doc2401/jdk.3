<h2><a name="916002"><i>1.0  </i> Introduction.
</a></h2>

<blockquote>
<a name="916293"><!-- --></a>
Currently the JavaBeans specification (Version 1.0) contains neither conventions describing a hierarchy or logical structure of JavaBeans, nor conventions for those JavaBeans to rendezvous with, or obtain arbitrary services or facilities from, the execution environment within which the JavaBean was instantiated.<p>
<a name="916686"><!-- --></a>
It is desirable to both provide a logical, traversable, hierarchy of JavaBeans, and further to provide a general mechanism whereby an object instantiating an arbitrary JavaBean can offer that JavaBean a variety of services, or interpose itself between the underlying system service and the JavaBean, in a conventional fashion.<p>
<a name="916294"><!-- --></a>
In other component models there exists the concept of a relationship between a Component and its environment, or Container, wherein a newly instantiated Component is provided with a reference to its Container or Embedding Context.<p>
<a name="916610"><!-- --></a>
The Container, or Embedding Context not only establishes the hierarchy or logical structure, but its also acts as a service provider that Components may interrogate in order to determine, and subsequently employ, the services provided by their Context.<p>
<a name="916323"><!-- --></a>
This proposal defines such a protocol that supports extensible mechanisms that:<p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<ul><li>
Introduce an abstraction for the environment, or context, in which a JavaBean logically functions during its lifecycle, that is a hierarchy or structure of JavaBeans.

<li>
Enable the dynamic addition of arbitrary services to a JavaBean&#39;s environment.

<li>
Provide a single service discovery mechanism through which JavaBeans may interrogate their environment in order both to ascertain the availability of particular services and to subsequently employ those services.

<li>
Provide a simple mechanism to propagate an Environment to a JavaBean.

<li>
Provide better support for JavaBeans that are also Applets.

</ul>
</ul>
