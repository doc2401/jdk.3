<h2><a name="916575"><i>4.0  </i> Providing better support for Beans that are also Applets
</a></h2>

<blockquote>
<a name="916480"><!-- --></a>
The current implementation of <em>java.beans.instantiate()</em> contains minimal support for instantiating JavaBeans that are also Applets. In particular, this method will currently construct an <em>AppletContext</em> and <em>AppletStub</em> for the newly instantiated JavaBean, set the stub on the newly instantiated <em>Applet,</em> and <em>init()</em> the <em>Applet</em> if it has not already been invoked.<p>
<a name="916481"><!-- --></a>
Unfortunately this does not provide sufficient support in order to allow most Applets to be fully functional, since the <em>AppletContext</em> and <em>AppletStub</em> created by <em>java.beans.instantiate()</em>, are no-ops. This is a direct consequence of the lack of sufficient specification of how to construct <em>AppletContext</em> and <em>AppletStub </em>implementations in the existing <em>Applet</em> API&#39;s. Furthermore, even if such specifications existed we would require an API that propagated a number of <em>Applet</em> attributes such as its Codebase, Parameters, <em>AppletContext</em>, and Documentbase into <em>java.beans.instantiate()</em> in order for it to subsequently instantiate the appropriately initialized objects.<p>
<a name="916596"><!-- --></a>
Since key to supporting fully functional Applets is to provide them with fully functional <em>AppletContext</em> and <em>AppletStub </em>instances, the design goal is to provide a mechanism to provide this state to <em>instantiate()</em> so that it may carry out the appropriate initialization and binding<a href="#foot1"><sup>1</sup></a>, therefore the proposed interface is:<p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><pre>
public static Object 
              instantiate(ClassLoader 		cl,
                          String      		beanName,
                          BeanContext 		bCtxt,
                          AppletInitializer	ai

			);

public interface AppletInitializer {
	void initialize(Applet newApplet, BeanContext bCtxt);
	void activate(Applet newApplet);

}
</pre></blockquote><blockquote>
<a name="916490"><!-- --></a>
If the newly instantiated JavaBean component is an instance of <em>java.applet.Apple</em>t then the new constructed <em>Applet</em>, (Bean) will be passed to the <em>AppletInitializer</em> via a call to <em>initialize(). </em><p>
<a name="919311"><!-- --></a>
Compliant implementations of <em>AppletInitializer.initialize()</em> shall:<p>
</blockquote><a name="919313"><!-- --></a>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Associate the newly instantiated <em>Applet</em> with the appropriate <em>AppletContext</em>.
<li>Instantiate an <em>AppletStub</em>() and associate that <em>AppletStub</em> with the <em>Applet</em> via an invocation of <em>setStub</em>().
<li>If <em>BeanContext</em> parameter is null, then it shall associate the <em>Applet</em> with its appropriate <em>Container</em> by adding that <em>Applet</em> to its <em>Container</em> via an invocation of <em>add</em>(). If the <em>BeanContext</em> parameter is non-null, then it is the responsibility of the <em>BeanContext</em> to associate the <em>Applet</em> with its <em>Container</em> during the subsequent invocation of its <em>addChildren</em>() method.
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<a name="919343"><!-- --></a>
Compliant implementations of <em>AppletInitializer.activate()</em> shall mark the <em>Applet</em> as active, and may optionally also invoke the <em>Applet</em>&#39;s <em>start()</em> method.<p>
<a name="919310"><!-- --></a>
Note that if the newly instantiated JavaBean is not an instance of <em>Applet</em>, then the <em>AppletInitializer </em>interface is ignored.<p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<a name="foot1"></a>
<li><em>AppletContext</em> objects expose a list of <em>Applet</em> objects
they "contain", unfortunately the current <em>Applet</em> or <em>AppletStub</em>
API's as defined, provide no mechanism for the <em>AppletContext</em> to 
discover its <em>Applets</em> from its <em>AppletStubs</em>, or for an
<em>AppletStub</em> to inform its <em>AppletContext</em> of its
<em>Applet</em>. Therefore we will have to assume that this binding/discovery
can occur in order for this mechanism to be worthwhile in
<em>java.beans.instantiate()</em>.
