<h2>	3	 Overview of New Features</h2>

<a name="282034"></a>
This chapter contains an overview of the new features that are being added to the JDBC 
API.
<p>

<a name="282396"></a>
<h3>3.1 	  &nbsp; &nbsp; Result set enhancements</h3>
<a name="299536"></a>
	The JDBC 1.0 API provided result sets that had the ability to scroll in a forward direction
only. Scrollable result sets allow for more flexibility in the processing of results by 
providing both forward and backward movement through their contents. In addition, 
scrollable result sets allow for relative and absolute positioning. For example, it's possible
to move to the fourth row in a scrollable result set directly, or to move directly to 
the third row following the current row, provided the row exists. 
<p>
<a name="299540"></a>
The JDBC API allows result sets to be directly updatable, as well.
<p>

<a name="299562"></a>
<h3>3.2 	  &nbsp; &nbsp; Batch updates</h3>
<a name="299563"></a>
The batch update feature allows an application to submit multiple update statements 
(insert/update/delete) in a single request to the database. This can provide a dramatic 
increase in performance when a large number of update statements need to be executed.
<p>

<a name="299552"></a>
<h3>3.3 	  &nbsp; &nbsp; Advanced data types</h3>
<a name="299553"></a>
Increased support for storing persistent Java programming language objects (Java objects
) and a mapping for SQL99 data types such as binary large objects, and structured 
types, has been added to the JDBC API. An application may also customize the mapping
of SQL99 structured types into Java programming language classes.
<p>

<a name="288219"></a>
<h3>3.4 	  &nbsp; &nbsp; Rowsets</h3>
<a name="282422"></a>
As its name implies, a rowset encapsulates a set of rows. A rowset may or may not 
maintain an open database connection. When a rowset is `disconnected' from its data 
source, updates performed on the rowset are propagated to the underlying database using
an optimistic concurrency control algorithm. 
<p>
<a name="284659"></a>
Rowsets add support to the JDBC API for the JavaBeans component model. A rowset 
object is a bean. A rowset implementation may be serializable. Rowsets can be created 
at design time and used in conjunction with other JavaBeans components in a visual 
builder tool to construct an application. 
<p>

<a name="282298"></a>
<h3>3.5 	  &nbsp; &nbsp; JNDI for naming databases</h3>
<a name="282457"></a>
The Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) API can be used in addition to a 
JDBC technology-based driver manager (JDBC driver manager) to obtain a connection 
to a database. When an application uses the JNDI API, it specifies a logical name that 
identifies a particular database instance and JDBC driver for accessing that database. 
This has the advantage of making the application code independent of a particular 
JDBC driver and JDBC technology URL.
<p>

<a name="282330"></a>
<h3>3.6 	  &nbsp; &nbsp; Connection Pooling </h3>
<a name="282472"></a>
The JDBC API contains `hooks' that allow connection pooling to be implemented on 
top of the JDBC driver layer. This allows for a single connection cache that spans the 
different JDBC drivers that may be in use. Since creating and destroying database connections
is expensive, connection pooling is important for achieving good performance, 
especially for server applications.
<p>

<a name="282470"></a>
<h3>3.7 	  &nbsp; &nbsp; Distributed transaction support</h3>
<a name="282485"></a>
Support for distributed transactions has been added as an extension to the JDBC API. 
This feature allows a JDBC driver to support the standard 2-phase commit protocol 
used by the Java Transaction Service (JTS) API.
<p>

<a name="282309"></a>
<h3>3.8 	  &nbsp; &nbsp; Other new features</h3>
<a name="282491"></a>
Support for character streams has been added. This means that character data can be retrieved
and sent to the database as a stream of internationalized Unicode characters. 
Methods to allow <code>java.math.BigDecimal</code> values to be returned with full precision 
have also been added. Support for time zones has been added.
