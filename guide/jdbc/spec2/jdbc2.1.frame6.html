<h2>	6	 Batch Updates</h2>

<a name="283239"></a>
The batch update facility allows multiple update operations to be submitted to a data 
source for processing at once. Submitting multiple updates together, instead of individually,
can greatly improve performance. <code>Statement</code>, <code>PreparedStatement</code>, and <code>CallableStatement
</code>objects can be used to submit batch updates. 
<p>

<a name="302396"></a>
<h3>6.1 	  &nbsp; &nbsp; Description of batch updates</h3>

<a name="283374"></a>
<h4>	6.1.1	 Statements</h4>
<a name="283286"></a>
The batch update facility allows a <code>Statement</code> object to submit a set of heterogeneous 
update commands together as a single unit, or batch, to the underlying DBMS. In the 
example below all of the update operations required to insert a new employee into a fictitious
company database are submitted as a single batch.
<p>
<a name="283316"></a>

<p>
<blockquote><pre>// turn off autocommit
con.setAutoCommit(false);

Statement stmt = con.createStatement();

stmt.addBatch("INSERT INTO employees VALUES (1000, 'Joe Jones')");
stmt.addBatch("INSERT INTO departments VALUES (260, 'Shoe')");
stmt.addBatch("INSERT INTO emp_dept VALUES (1000, 260)");

// submit a batch of update commands for execution
int[] updateCounts = stmt.executeBatch();


</pre></blockquote><a name="283392"></a>
In the example, autocommit mode is disabled to prevent the driver from committing the 
transaction when <code>Statement.executeBatch()</code> is called. Disabling autocommit allows 
an application to decide whether or not to commit the transaction in the event that an 
error occurs and some of the commands in a batch cannot be processed successfully. 
For this reason, autocommit should always be turned off when batch updates are done. 
The commit behavior of <code>executeBatch</code> is always implementation defined when an error
occurs and autocommit is true.
<p>
<a name="283325"></a>
To keep our discussion of batch updates general, we define the term <em>element</em> to refer to 
an individual member of a batch. As we have seen, an element in a batch is just a simple 
command when a <code>Statement</code> object is being used. Although we are focusing on using 
<code>Statement</code> objects to do batch updates in this section, the discussion that follows applies
to <code>PreparedStatment</code> and <code>CallableStatement</code> objects, as well.
<p>
<a name="302787"></a>
In the new JDBC API, a <code>Statement</code> object has the ability to keep track of a list of commands
-or batch-that can be submitted together for execution. When a <code>Statement</code> 
object is created, its associated batch is empty-the batch contains no elements. The 
<code>Statement.addBatch() </code>method adds an element to the calling statement's batch. The 
method <code>Statement.clearBatch()</code> (not shown above) can be called to reset a batch if 
the application decides not to submit a batch of commands that has been constructed 
for a statement.
<p>
<a name="302656"></a>
<b>Successful execution</b>
<p>
<a name="283340"></a>
The <code>Statement.executeBatch()</code> method submits a statement's batch to the underlying
data source for execution. Batch elements are executed serially (at least logically) 
in the order in which they were added to the batch. When all of the elements in a batch 
execute successfully, <code>executeBatch() </code>returns an integer array containing one entry 
for each element in the batch. The entries in the array are ordered according to the order 
in which the elements were processed (which, again, is the same as the order in which 
the elements were originally added to the batch). An entry in the array may have the 
following values:
<p>
<ol><a name="302416"></a>
<li>If the value of an array entry is greater than or equal to zero, then the batch 
element was processed successfully and the value is an update count indicating 
the number of rows in the database that were effected by the element's 
execution.

<a name="302417"></a>
<li>A value of -2 indicates that a element was processed successfully, but that the 
number of effected rows is unknown. 

</ol><a name="302415"></a>
Calling<code> executeBatch()</code> closes the calling <code>Statement</code> object's current result set if one 
is open. The statement's internal list of batch elements is reset to empty once <code>executeBatch()
</code> returns. The behavior of the <code>executeQuery</code>, <code>executeUpdate</code>, or <code>execute</code> 
methods is implementation defined when a statement's batch is non-empty.
<p>
<a name="284570"></a>
<code>ExecuteBatch()</code> throws a <code>BatchUpdateException</code> if any of the elements in the batch 
fail to execute properly, or if an element attempts to return a result set. Only DDL and 
DML commands that return a simple update count may be executed as part of a batch. 
When a <code>BatchUpdateException</code> is thrown, the <code>BatchUpdateException.getUpdateCounts()
</code> method can be called to obtain an integer array of update counts that describes
the outcome of the batch execution. 
<p>
<a name="302657"></a>
<b>Handling failures during execution</b>
<p>
<a name="302439"></a>
A JDBC driver may or may not continue processing the remaining elements in a batch 
once execution of an element in a batch fails. However, a JDBC driver must always provide
the same behavior when used with a particular DBMS. For example, a driver cannot
continue processing after a failure for one batch, and not continue processing for 
another batch. 
<p>
<a name="302845"></a>
If a driver stops processing after the first failure, the array returned by <code>BatchUpdateException.getUpdateCounts()
</code> will always contain fewer entries than there were elements
in the batch. Since elements are executed in the order that they are added to the 
batch, if the array contains N elements, this means that the first N elements in the batch 
were processed successfully when <code>executeBatch()</code> was called. 
<p>
<a name="302645"></a>
When a driver continues processing in the presence of failures, the number of elements, 
N, in the array returned by <code>BatchUpdateException.getUpdateCounts()</code>is always 
equal to the number of elements in the batch. The following additional array value is 
returned when a <code>BatchUpdateException</code> is thrown and the driver continues processing 
after a failure:
<p>
<ol start=3><a name="302434"></a>
<li>A value of -3 indicates that the command or element failed to execute 
successfully. This value is also returned for elements that could not be 
processed for some reason-such elements fail implicitly.

</ol><a name="302581"></a>
JDBC drivers that do not continue processing after a failure never return -3 in an update 
count array. Drivers of this type simply return a status array containing an entry for each 
command that was processed successfully. 
<p>
<a name="302629"></a>
A JDBC technology based application can distinguish a JDBC driver that continues 
processing after a failure from one that does not by examining the size of the array returned
by <code>BatchUpdateException.getUpdateCounts()</code>. A JDBC driver that continues
processing always returns an array containing one entry for each element in the 
batch. A JDBC driver that does not continue processing after a failure will always return
an array whose number of entries is less than the number of elements in the batch.
<p>

<a name="302606"></a>
<h4>	6.1.2	 PreparedStatements</h4>
<a name="283404"></a>
An element in a batch consists of a parameterized command and an associated set of 
parameters when a <code>PreparedStatement</code> is used. The batch update facility is used with 
a <code>PreparedStatement</code> to associate multiple sets of input parameter values with a single 
<code>PreparedStatement </code>object. The sets of parameter values together with their associated
parameterized update command can then be sent to the underlying DBMS engine for 
execution as a single unit.
<p>
<a name="283428"></a>
The example below inserts two new employee records into a database as a single batch. 
The <code>PreparedStatement.setXXX()</code> methods are used to create each parameter set 
(one for each employee), while the <code>PreparedStatement.addBatch()</code> method adds a 
set of parameters to the current batch.
<p>
<a name="283503"></a>

<p>
<blockquote><pre>// turn off autocommit
con.setAutoCommit(false);

PreparedStatement stmt = con.prepareStatement(
	"INSERT INTO employees VALUES (?, ?)");

stmt.setInt(1, 2000);
stmt.setString(2, "Kelly Kaufmann");
stmt.addBatch();

stmt.setInt(1, 3000);
stmt.setString(2, "Bill Barnes");
stmt.addBatch();
 
// submit the batch for execution
int[] updateCounts = stmt.executeBatch();


</pre></blockquote><a name="302592"></a>
Finally, <code>PreparedStatement.executeBatch()</code> is called to submit the updates to the 
DBMS. Calling <code>PreparedStatement.executeBatch() </code>clears the statement's associated
list of batch elements. The array returned by <code>PreparedStatement.executeBatch()
</code> contains an element for each set of parameters in the batch, similar to the case 
for <code>Statement</code>. Each element either contains an update count or the generic `success' 
indicator (-2).
<p>
<a name="302500"></a>
Error handling in the case of<code> PreparedStatement </code>objects is the same as error handling
in the case of <code>Statement</code> objects. Some drivers may stop processing as soon as 
an error occurs, while others may continue processing the rest of the batch. As for 
<code>Statement</code>, the number of elements in the array returned by <code>BatchUpdateException.getUpdateCounts()
</code>indicates whether or not the driver continues processing 
after a failure. The same three array element values are possible, as for <code>Statement</code>. The 
order of the entries in the array is the same order as the order in which elements were 
added to the batch.
<p>

<a name="283558"></a>
<h4>	6.1.3	 Callable Statements</h4>
<a name="283559"></a>
The batch update facility works the same with <code>CallableStatement</code> objects as it does 
with <code>PreparedStatement</code> objects. Multiple sets of input parameter values may be associated
with a callable statement and sent to the DBMS together. Stored procedures 
invoked using the batch update facility with a callable statement must return an update 
count, and may not have out or inout parameters. The <code>CallableStatement.executeBatch()
</code> method should throw an exception if this restriction is violated. Error handling 
is analogous to <code>PreparedStatement</code>.
<p>

<a name="302387"></a>
<h3>6.2 	  &nbsp; &nbsp; What's required</h3>
<a name="302619"></a>
Support for batch updates is optional. If a JDBC driver supports batch updates, then the 
<code>DatabaseMetaData.supportsBatchUpdates()</code> method must return true, else it must 
return false. In addition, to preserve backward compatibility, JDBC drivers that do not 
continue processing after a failure are not required to return a value of -2 as described 
in <a href="jdbc2.1.frame6.html#302396">Section 6.1</a>, however, this is encouraged. JDBC drivers that continue processing are 
required to support both of the negative return values.
<p>
<a name="302610"></a>
Note: In the future, the JDBC API shall define symbolic constants for the negative array 
entry values described in <a href="jdbc2.1.frame6.html#302396">Section 6.1</a>. These values have been added as an addendum 
to the original JDBC 2.0 API specification.
