<h2>	1	 Introduction</h2>


<a name="249771"></a>
<h3>1.1 	  &nbsp; &nbsp; Preface</h3>
<a name="300829"></a>
This document contains the final specification of the JDBC<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> 2.1 Core API. 
<p>

<a name="303721"></a>
<h3>1.2 	  &nbsp; &nbsp; Target audience</h3>
<a name="203942"></a>
The target audience for this document includes vendors of JDBC technology-based 
drivers (JDBC drivers) whose products implement the JDBC API, other vendors who 
want to provide support for the JDBC API in their products, and end-users developing 
applications using the JDBC API.
<p>

<a name="203666"></a>
<h3>1.3 	  &nbsp; &nbsp; Background</h3>
<a name="281618"></a>
The initial release of the JDBC API has been well received by both end-users developing
database applications using Java<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> technology, and vendors of database products. 
Due to its wide acceptance, the JDBC API has become an API that is core to the Java 
platform. We would like to thank everyone who has worked on or used JDBC technology
for helping to make it successful.
<p>
<a name="284838"></a>
Since the first release of the JDBC API, we have received valuable feedback from the 
members of the community of JDBC technology users regarding new features that 
would make useful additions to the API. We are continuing to solicit additional input 
and ideas from everyone who has an interest in JDBC technology, and we encourage 
everyone to send us their requests and ideas for new features and directions.

<h3>1.4 	  &nbsp; &nbsp; Organization</h3>
<a name="302147"></a>
The JDBC API has been separated into two parts: the core JDBC 2.1 API and the JDBC 
2.0 Optional Package API. Chapters 2 and 3 of this document discuss goals and give an 
overview of the JDBC API as a whole. The remainder of the document contains a detailed
specification of the core JDBC 2.1 API. A detailed specification for the JDBC 2.0 
Optional Package API is presented in a separate document. 
<p>

<a name="302243"></a>
<h3>1.5 	  &nbsp; &nbsp; Terminology</h3>
<a name="302244"></a>
In this document we refer to the previous release of the JDBC API as the JDBC 1.0 API.
<p>

<a name="281563"></a>
<h3>1.6 	  &nbsp; &nbsp; Acknowledgments</h3>
<a name="302238"></a>
The JDBC API design effort has been a broad industry effort that has involved over 
twenty partner companies. We would like to thank the many reviewers who have contributed
to previous versions of the specification. We especially thank Gray Clossman 
and Stefan Dessloch for making the initial proposal for adding SQL99 types to the 
JDBC API.
