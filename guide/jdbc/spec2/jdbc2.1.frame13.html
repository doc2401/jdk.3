<h2>Appendix B:  Additional Suggestions </h2>

<a name="282047"></a>
This section contains a list of some of the suggested additions that we received that have 
<strong>not</strong> been added to the JDBC API. They are listed simply as a record of some of the 
things that have been left out. We welcome input concerning the items listed here.
<p>

<a name="281852"></a>
<h2>B.1 	  &nbsp;&nbsp; Other Suggestions for v0.1</h2>
<a name="284716"></a>
Processing Results - Add a way to determine the value of an auto-incremented key after 
an insert is done.
<p>
<a name="282325"></a>
Enhanced Meta-Data - Add meta-data for prepared statement parameters and for prepared
statement result set. The JDBC API does not provide metadata describing a prepared
statements parameters; and, it does not provide metadata describing its results 
without executing the statement (equivalent to SQL92 DESCRIBE OUTPUT and 
ODBC SQLDescribeParam.
<p>
<a name="281853"></a>
New Data Types - Add the SQL time interval data type
<p>
<a name="281857"></a>
Security - Allow the application to choose underlying transport properties, e.g., SSL. 
Provide SSL Socket implementation. A JDBC technology based application must be 
able to select driver-supported mechanisms for securing the wirelevel protocol (e.g., 
encryption). Relative to SSL, one option is to allow the application to specify a specific 
Cyphersuite (key-exchange algorithm, bulk-encryption, MAC [message authentication 
algorithm])
<p>
<a name="281859"></a>
Security-Authentication - Allow an application to select driver-supported mechanisms 
for performing authentication. The following mechanisms should be supported: Username,
password; Kerberos token; Digital Certificates
<p>
<a name="281862"></a>
Command Complete event - Support a user provided event object that is fired when a 
Command completes (both current command and regular command, sync or async). - - 
Various events: Connect Event; Disconnect Event; Before Connect Event
<p>
<a name="281863"></a>
Cursor Implementation Location - Support client-side vs server-side.
<p>
<a name="281865"></a>
Parameter Management -  Support: Append, GetCount,  GetItem (by name/position),  
Delete and  Refresh.
<p>
<a name="281872"></a>
Hybrid SQL/Java programming language Integration - Provide a mechanism for defining
Java classess and provide a hybrid SQL/Java query mechanism over Tables whose 
columns may be SQL atomics or Java classes.
<p>
<a name="281873"></a>
Specialty Data Types - Provide extensions for OLAP, Spatial, TimeSeries and other 
Specialty Data Types.
<p>
<a name="281874"></a>
Serializing data, time, timestamps - Allow these types to be serializable.
<p>
<a name="281875"></a>
Async Requests - Allow the caller to request that a Statement execute asynchronously.
<p>
<a name="281876"></a>
Java classes - Introduce the notion of a SQL specialization of Java classes/beans that 
introduces SQL99 concepts useful for dealing with Java objects in the context of databases
and business applications. For example, it is useful for a database system to understand
which method(s) definitions in a Class may be used to perform operations on 
objects such as comparisons, etc. One approach would be to introduce "generic" method
names. Those could also be used outside of the database by regular Business Applications.

<p>
<a name="281877"></a>
Add support for SQL PSM.
<p>
<a name="281878"></a>
Add additional SQL language functionality e.g. various forms of join.
<p>
<a name="281879"></a>
Add *levels* of JDBC compatibility, as opposed to individual API calls to see if individual
features are supported by a drvier.
<p>
<a name="281880"></a>
Add an API call that describes the format of the URL understood by a driver.
<p>
<a name="281881"></a>
Add a row object that encapsulates database data in its native format.
<p>
<a name="282201"></a>
Add immutability for Date, Time, Timestamp.
<p>

<a name="281850"></a>
<h2>B.2 	  &nbsp;&nbsp; Additional suggestions for v0.7</h2>

<ul><a name="288240"></a>
<li>It was suggested that as an alternative to providing individual methods for each 
new property on the <code>Statement</code> interface such as result set type, concurrency 
type, etc., we could introduce a new Class, <code>ResultSetProperties</code>, that itself 
contained all methods for getting and setting these properties. Statement would 
then just contain two new methods for getting and setting a 
<code>ResultSetProperties</code> property. This approach would help to simplify the 
<code>Statement</code> interface.
<br><br>
<a name="293573"></a>
<li>Add a new CursorResultSet interface which extends ResultSet and adds method 
<code>CursorStatement prepareUpdate() throws SQLException</code>; OR add the 
<code>prepareUpdate</code> method to the existing <code>ResultSet</code> interface - and define that it 
may fail if there is no cursor associated with it. Add a new <code>CursorStatement</code> 
interface which extends <code>PreparedStatement</code> and adds the methods:<code> void 
update() throws SQLException </code>and<code> void delete() throws 
SQLException</code>. It would be helpful to introduce another intermediate 
<code>CursorResultSet</code> which would sit in the interitance hierarchy between 
<code>ResultSet</code> and <code>ScrollableResultSet</code>. The motivation for the 
CursorStatement is to avoid the need to parse every query to look for cursor 
operations. The reason to have CursorStatement extend PreparedStatement is to 
get access to the setXXX methods. The setXXX() methods would be used to 
provide new values to the corresponding columns of the current row in the 
CursorResultSet. The executeUpdate() method would perform the actual update 
(with the parameter values that had been set) or delete (parameter values are 
ignored). The execute() and executeQuery() methods would be overridden so 
that they always throw SQLException. Additionally, the CursorStatement 
would be "bound" to the CursorResultSet which created it such that whenever 
that CursorResultSet was repositioned (next, relative, absolute, first, last, etc.) 
that the CursorStatement would automatically track this and update/delete 
methods affect the right row. ** It is tempting to do away with the 
CursorStatement and just add that functionality to the CursorResultSet because 
these things are likely to be in 1:1 relationship.
<br><br>
<a name="293575"></a>
<li>Add to the <code>Statement</code> interface: <code>void 
setCursorProperties(CursorProperties props) throws SQLException</code>; 
Define a new <code>java.sql.CursorProperties</code> class. I like the idea of adding 
statement properties so that appropriate subclasses of <code>ResultSet</code> are returned 
when the statement is executed. But, rather than adding a bunch of individual 
accessors/mutators for all these properties to <code>Statement</code>, I would recommend 
defining a <code>CursorProperties</code> class with public members and then add just a 
single new method to <code>Statement</code>: <code>void 
setCursorProperties(CursorProperties props) throws SQLException</code>; 
This would remove the need for the new <code>Statement.setFetchSize</code> and 
<code>getFetchSize</code> methods for example. <code>CursorProperties</code> would have a public 
constructor which returns a <code>CursorProperties</code> object with well defined 
default values (TBD). Members of this class would include: 0. boolean 
useCursors - if true the statement should return a <code>CursorResultSet</code> from 
executeQuery. 1. String cursorName - <code>Statement.setCursorName()</code> would be 
depricated. 2. boolean scrollable - if true the statement should return a 
<code>ScrollableResultSet</code> from execute query. 3. boolean readonly - if true this 
cursor is READONLY. 4. int rowCacheSize - hint to driver on how many rows 
to retrieve from the database at a time. 5. boolean closeOnEndTransaction - in 
ANSI SQL '92 cursors are automatically closed on commit/rollback, but many 
databases allow cursors to remain open for efficiency 6. String[] 
updatableColumns - list of columns which in SQL '92 grammar would be in the 
"FOR UPDATE OF &lt;column list&gt;" clause. 7. boolean sensitive - if true 
committed changes to the underlying tables which happened while the cursor 
was open may be seen by the application as it scrolls over those rows.
<br><br>
<a name="293570"></a>
<li>The result of any SQL query can be thought of as defining a simple structured 
type. The fields of the structured type correspond to the columns of the query 
result, and each row in the result set returned by the query represents an instance 
of the type. The JDBC API could allow a mapping from a type that is defined 
implicitly by an SQL query to a Java class, or even a bi-directional mapping 
between regular relational tables and Java classes.
