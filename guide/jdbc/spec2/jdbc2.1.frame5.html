<h2>	5	 Result Set Enhancements </h2>

<a name="300864"></a>
This chapter discusses the new functionality that has been added to result sets. The goal 
of the enhancements is to add two new basic capabilities to result sets: scrolling and updat
ability. Several methods have also been added to enable a JDBC driver to deliver improved
performance when processing results. A variety of examples are included to 
illustrate the new features. 
<p>

<a name="300869"></a>
<h3>5.1 	  &nbsp; &nbsp; Scrolling</h3>
<a name="287374"></a>
A result set created by executing a statement may support the ability to move backward 
(last-to-first) through its contents, as well as forward (first-to-last). Result sets that support
this capability are called scrollable result sets. Result sets that are scrollable also 
support relative and absolute positioning. Absolute positioning is the ability to move 
directly to a row by specifying its absolute position in the result set, while relative positioning
gives the ability to move to a row by specifying a position that is relative to 
the current row. The definition of absolute and relative positioning in the JDBC API is 
modeled on the X/Open SQL CLI specification.
<p>

<a name="287179"></a>
<h3>5.2 	  &nbsp; &nbsp; Result Set types</h3>
<a name="293718"></a>
The JDBC 1.0 API provided one result set type-forward-only. The JDBC 2.1 core API 
provides three result set types: forward-only, scroll-insensitive, and scroll-sensitive. As 
their names suggest, the new result set types support scrolling, but they differ in their 
ability to make changes visible while they are open. 
<p>
<a name="287232"></a>
A <b>scroll-insensitive</b> result set is generally <b>not</b> sensitive to changes that are made while 
it is open. A scroll-insensitive result set provides a static view of the underlying data it 
contains. The membership, order, and column values of rows in a scroll-insensitive result
set are typically fixed when the result set is created.
<p>
<a name="287238"></a>
On the other hand, a <b>scroll-sensitive</b> result set is sensitive to changes that are made 
while it is open, and provides a `dynamic' view of the underlying data. For example, 
when using a scroll-sensitive result set, changes in the underlying column values of 
rows are visible. The membership and ordering of rows in the result set may be fixed-
this is implementation defined.
<p>

<a name="287368"></a>
<h3>5.3 	  &nbsp; &nbsp; Concurrency types</h3>
<a name="287393"></a>
An application may choose from two different concurrency types for a result set: read-
only and updatable. 
<p>
<a name="301562"></a>
A result set that uses <strong>read-only</strong> concurrency does not allow updates of its contents. This 
can increase the overall level of concurrency between transactions, since any number 
of read-only locks may be held on a data item simultaneously.
<p>
<a name="287404"></a>
A result set that is <strong>updatable</strong> allows updates and may use database write locks to mediate
access to the same data item by different transactions. Since only a single write 
lock may be held at a time on a data item, this can reduce concurrency. Alternatively, 
an optimistic concurrency control scheme may be used if it is thought that conflicting 
accesses to data will be rare. Optimistic concurrency control implementations typically 
compare rows either by value or by a version number to determine if an update conflict 
has occurred.
<p>

<a name="287201"></a>
<h3>5.4 	  &nbsp; &nbsp; Performance</h3>
<a name="287418"></a>
Two performance hints may be given to a JDBC 2.1 technology-enabled driver to make 
access to result set data more efficient. Specifically, the number of rows to be fetched 
from the database each time more rows are needed can be specified, and a direction for 
processing the rows-forward, reverse, or unknown-can be given as well. These values
can be changed for an individual result set at any time. A JDBC driver may ignore 
a performance hint if it chooses.
<p>

<a name="293762"></a>
<h3>5.5 	  &nbsp; &nbsp; Creating a result set</h3>
<a name="287223"></a>
The example below illustrates creation of a result set that is forward-only and uses read-
only concurrency. No performance hints are given by the example, so the driver is free 
to do whatever it thinks will result in the best performance. The transaction isolation 
level for the connection is not specified, so the default transaction isolation level of the 
underlying database is used for the result set that is created. Note that this code is just 
written using the JDBC 1.0 API, and that it produces the same type of result set that 
would have been produced by the JDBC 1.0 API.
<p>
<a name="287450"></a>

<p>
<blockquote><pre>Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(
	"jdbc:my_subprotocol:my_subname");
Statement stmt = con.createStatement();
ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(
	"SELECT emp_no, salary FROM employees");
</pre></blockquote><a name="287425"></a>

<p>
<a name="287455"></a>
The next example creates a scrollable result set that is updatable and sensitive to updates.
Rows of data are requested to be fetched twenty-five at-a-time from the database. 
<p>
<a name="300935"></a>

<p>
<blockquote><pre>Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(
	"jdbc:my_subprotocol:my_subname");

Statement stmt = con.createStatement(
	ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE,
	ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE);
stmt.setFetchSize(25);

ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(
	"SELECT emp_no, salary FROM employees");


</pre></blockquote><a name="287532"></a>
The example below creates a result set with the same attributes as the previous example, 
however, a prepared statement is used to produce the result set. 
<p>
<a name="302150"></a>

<p>
<blockquote><pre>PreparedStatement pstmt = con.prepareStatement(
	"SELECT emp_no, salary FROM employees where emp_no = ?",
	ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE, 
	ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE);

pstmt.setFetchSize(25);
pstmt.setString(1, "100010");
ResultSet rs = pstmt.executeQuery();


</pre></blockquote><a name="301917"></a>
The method <code>DatabaseMetaData.supportsResultSetType()</code> can be called to see 
which result set types are supported by a JDBC driver. However, an application may 
still ask a JDBC driver to create a <code>Statement</code>, <code>PreparedStatement</code>, or <code>CallableStatement
</code> object using a result set type that the driver does not support. In this 
case, the driver should issue an <code>SQLWarning</code> on the <code>Connection </code>that produces the 
statement and choose an alternative value for the result set type of the statement according
to the following rules:
<p>
<ol><a name="301932"></a>
<li>If an application asks for a scrollable result set type the driver should use a 
scrollable type that it supports, even if this differs from the exact type requested 
by the application.

<a name="301935"></a>
<li>If the application asks for a scrollable result set type and the driver does not 
support scrolling, then the driver should use a forward-only result set type.

</ol><a name="301949"></a>
Similarly, the method <code>DatabaseMetaData.supportsResultSetConcurrency() </code>can 
be called to determine which concurrency types are supported by a driver. If an application
asks a JDBC driver for a concurrency type that it does not support then the driver 
should issue an <code>SQLWarning</code> on the <code>Connection </code>that produces the statement and 
choose the alternative concurrency type. The choice of result set type should be made 
first if an application specifies both an unsupported result set type and an unsupported 
concurrency type.
<p>
<a name="301961"></a>
In some instances, a JDBC driver may need to choose an alternate result set type or concurrency
type for a <code>ResultSet</code> at statement execution time. For example, a SELECT 
statement that contains a join over multiple tables may not produce a <code>ResultSet</code> that is 
updatable. The JDBC driver should issue an <code>SQLWarning</code> in this case on the <code>Statement</code>, 
<code>PreparedStatement</code>, or <code>CallableStatement</code> that produces the <code>ResultSet</code> and 
choose an appropriate result set type or concurrency type as described above. An application
may determine the actual result set type and concurrency type of a <code>ResultSet</code> 
by calling the <code>ResultSet.getType()</code> and <code>getConcurrency()</code> methods, respectively.
<p>

<a name="287199"></a>
<h3>5.6 	  &nbsp; &nbsp; Updates</h3>
<a name="287587"></a>
A result set is updatable if its concurrency type is <code>CONCUR_UPDATABLE</code>. Rows in an updatable
result set may be updated, inserted, and deleted. The example below updates the 
first row of a result set. The <code>ResultSet.updateXXX()</code> methods are used to modify the 
value of an individual column in the current row, but do not update the underlying database.
When the <code>ResultSet.updateRow()</code> method is called the database is updated. 
Columns may be specified by name or number.
<p>
<a name="287622"></a>

<p>
<blockquote><pre>rs.first();
rs.updateString(1, "100020");
rs.updateFloat("salary", 10000.0f);
rs.updateRow();
</pre></blockquote><a name="287182"></a>

<p>
<a name="301986"></a>
The updates that an application makes must be discarded by a JDBC driver if the application
moves the cursor from the current row before calling <code>updateRow()</code>. In addition, 
an application can call the <code>ResultSet.cancelRowUpdates() </code>method to explicitly 
cancel the updates that have been made to a row. The <code>cancelRowUpdates()</code> method 
must be called after calling <code>updateXXX()</code> and before calling <code>updateRow()</code>, otherwise 
it has no effect.
<p>
<a name="287615"></a>
The following example illustrates deleting a row. The fifth row in the result set is deleted
from the database.
<p>
<a name="287627"></a>

<p>
<blockquote><pre>rs.absolute(5);
rs.deleteRow();

</pre></blockquote><a name="287631"></a>

<p>
<a name="301484"></a>
The example below shows how a new row may be inserted into a result set. The JDBC 
API defines the concept of an <em>insert row</em> that is associated with each result set and is 
used as a staging area for creating the contents of a new row before it is inserted into 
the result set itself. The <code>ResultSet.moveToInsertRow()</code> method is used to position 
the result set's cursor on the insert row. The <code>ResultSet.updateXXX()</code> and <code>ResultSet.getXXX()
</code> methods are used to update and retrieve individual column values from 
the insert row. The contents of the insert row is undefined immediately after calling <code>ResultSet.moveToInsertRow()
</code>. In other words, the value returned by calling a <code>ResultSet.getXXX()
</code> method is undefined after <code>moveToInsertRow()</code> is called until the 
value is set by calling <code>ResultSet.updateXXX()</code>.
<p>
<a name="301480"></a>
Calling <code>ResultSet.updateXXX()</code> while on the insert row does not update the underlying
database or the result set. Once all of the column values are set in the insert row, 
<code>ResultSet.insertRow() </code>is called to update the result set and the database simultaneously.
 If a column is not given a value by calling <code>updateXXX()</code> while on the insert 
row, or a column is missing from the result set, then that column must allow a null value.
Otherwise, calling <code>insertRow()</code> throws an <code>SQLException</code>.
<p>
<a name="287633"></a>

<p>
<blockquote><pre>rs.moveToInsertRow();
rs.updateString(1, "100050");
rs.updateFloat(2, 1000000.0f);
rs.insertRow();
rs.first();


</pre></blockquote><a name="287661"></a>
A result set remembers the current cursor position "in the result set" while its cursor is 
temporarily positioned on the insert row. To leave the insert row, any of the usual cursor 
positioning methods may be called, including the special method <code>ResultSet.moveToCurrentRow()
</code>which returns the cursor to the row which was the current 
row before <code>ResultSet.moveToInsertRow()</code> was called. In the example above, <code>ResultSet.first()
</code> is called to leave the insert row and move to the first row of the result
set.
<p>
<a name="303893"></a>
Due to differences in database implementations, the JDBC API does not specify an exact
set of SQL queries which must yield an updatable result set for JDBC drivers that 
support updatability. Developers can, however, generally expect queries which meet 
the following criteria to produce an updatable result set:
<p>
<ol><a name="303894"></a>
<li>The query references only a single table in the database.

<a name="302170"></a>
<li>The query does not contain any join operations.

<a name="302171"></a>
<li>The query selects the primary key of the table it references.

</ol><a name="302176"></a>
In addition, an SQL query should also satisfy the conditions listed below if inserts are 
to be performed.
<p>
<ol start=4><a name="302177"></a>
<li>The query selects all of the non-nullable columns in the underlying table.

<a name="302178"></a>
<li>The query selects all columns that don't have a default value.

</ol>
<a name="287739"></a>
<h3>5.7 	  &nbsp; &nbsp; Cursor movement examples</h3>
<a name="301552"></a>
A result set maintains an internal pointer called a <em>cursor</em> that indicates the row in the 
result set that is currently being accessed. A result set cursor is analogous to the cursor 
on a computer screen which indicates the current screen position. The cursor maintained
by a forward-only result set can only move forward through the contents of the 
result set. Thus, rows are accessed sequentially beginning with the first row.
<p>
<a name="287742"></a>
Iterating forward through a result set is done by calling the <code>ResultSet.next()</code> method, 
as with the JDBC 1.0 API. In addition, scrollable result sets-any result set whose type 
is not forward only-implement the method, <code>beforeFirst()</code>, which may be called to 
position the cursor before the first row in the result set. 
<p>
<a name="287782"></a>
The example below positions the cursor before the first row and then iterates forward 
through the contents of the result set. The <code>getXXX()</code> methods, which are JDBC 1.0 API 
methods, are used to retrieve column values. 
<p>
<blockquote><pre>
rs.beforeFirst();
while ( rs.next()) {
	System.out.println(rs.getString("emp_no") + 
			   " " + rs.getFloat("salary"));
}
</pre></blockquote><a name="287749"></a>

<p>
<a name="287750"></a>
Of course, one may iterate backward through a scrollable result set as well, as is shown 
below.
<p>
<a name="287751"></a>

<p>
<blockquote><pre>rs.afterLast(); 
while (rs.previous()) {
	System.out.println(rs.getString("emp_no") + 
		" " + rs.getFloat("salary"));
}

</pre></blockquote><a name="287758"></a>
In this example, the <code>ResultSet.afterLast()</code> method positions the scrollable result 
set's cursor after the last row in the result set. The <code>ResultSet.previous()</code> method is 
called to move the cursor to the last row, then the next to last, and so on. <code>ResultSet.previous()
</code> returns <code>false</code> when there are no more rows, so the loop ends after all 
of the rows have been visited.
<p>
<a name="287759"></a>
After examining the <code>ResultSet</code> interface, the reader will no doubt recognize that there 
is more than one way to iterate through the rows of a scrollable result set. It pays to be 
careful, however, as is illustrated by the following example, which shows one alternative
that is incorrect.
<p>
<blockquote><pre>
// incorrect!!!
while (!rs.isAfterLast()) {
	rs.relative(1);
	System.out.println(rs.getString("emp_no") + 
		 " " + rs.getFloat("salary"));
}


</pre></blockquote><a name="287768"></a>
This example attempts to iterate forward through a scrollable result set and is incorrect 
for several reasons. One error is that if <code>ResultSet.isAfterLast()</code> is called when the 
result set is empty, it will return a value of false since there is no last row, and the loop 
body will be executed, which is not what is wanted. An additional problem occurs when 
the cursor is positioned before the first row of a result set that contains data. In this case 
calling <code>rs.relative(1)</code> is erroneous since there is no current row.
<p>
<a name="287769"></a>
The code sample below fixes the problems in the previous example. Here a call to <code>ResultSet.first()
</code> is used to distinguish the case of an empty result set from one which 
contains data. Since <code>ResultSet.isAfterLast()</code> is only called when the result set is 
non-empty the loop control works correctly, and <code>ResultSet.relative(1)</code> steps 
through the rows of the result set since <code>ResultSet.first()</code> initially positions the cursor
on the first row.
<p>
<blockquote><pre>if (rs.first()) {
	while (!rs.isAfterLast()) {
		System.out.println(rs.getString("emp_no") + 
			" " + rs.getFloat("salary"));
	    	rs.relative(1);
	}
}
</pre></blockquote><a name="287740"></a>

<p>

<a name="300944"></a>
<h3>5.8 	  &nbsp; &nbsp; Detecting and viewing changes</h3>
<a name="300945"></a>
So far, we have introduced the different result set types and shown a few examples of 
how a result set of a particular type can be created, updated, and traversed. This section 
goes into more detail on the differences between result set types, and what these differences
mean for an application that uses result sets.
<p>
<a name="300946"></a>
The different result set types-forward-only, scroll-insensitive, and scroll-sensitive-
provided by the JDBC API vary greatly in their ability to make changes in the underlying
data visible to an application. This aspect of result sets is particularly interesting for 
the result set types which support scrolling, since they allow a particular row to be visited
multiple times while a result set is open.
<p>

<a name="300947"></a>
<h4>	5.8.1	 Visibility of changes</h4>
<a name="300948"></a>
We begin the discussion of this topic by describing the visibility of changes at the transaction
level. First, note the seemingly obvious fact that all of the updates that a transaction
makes are visible to itself. However, the changes (updates, inserts, and deletes) 
made by other transactions that are visible to a particular transaction are determined by 
the transaction isolation level. The isolation level for a transaction can be set by calling
<p>
<a name="300949"></a>

<p>
<blockquote><pre>con.setTransactionIsolation(TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED);


</pre></blockquote><a name="300953"></a>
where the variable <code>con</code> has type <code>Connection</code>. If all transactions in a system execute at 
the TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED isolation level or higher, then a transaction will 
only see the committed changes of other transactions. The changes that are visible to a 
result set's enclosing transaction when a result set is opened are always visible through 
the result set. In fact, this is what it means for an update made by one transaction to be 
visible to another transaction. 
<p>
<a name="300954"></a>
But what about changes made while a result set is open? Are they visible through the 
result set by, for example, calling <code>ResultSet.getXXX()</code>? Whether a particular result 
set exposes changes to its underlying data made by other transactions, other result sets 
that are part of the same transaction (We refer to these two types of changes collectively 
as `other's changes'.), or itself while the result set is open depends on the result set type. 
<p>

<a name="300955"></a>
<h4>	5.8.2	 Other's changes</h4>
<a name="300956"></a>
A scroll-insensitive result set does not make any changes visible that are made by others
-other transactions and other result sets in the same transaction-once the result set 
is opened. The content of a scroll-insensitive result set with respect to changes made by 
others is static-the membership, ordering, and row values are fixed. For example, if 
another transaction deletes a row that is contained in a static result set while it is open, 
the row remains visible. One way to implement a scroll-insensitive result set is to create 
a private copy of the result set's data.
<p>
<a name="300957"></a>
Scroll-sensitive result sets lie at the opposite end of the spectrum. A scroll-sensitive result
set makes all of the updates made by <strong>others </strong>that are visible to its enclosing transaction
visible. Inserts and deletes may not be visible, however. 
<p>
<a name="301617"></a>
Let us define carefully what it means for updates to be visible. If an update made by 
another transaction affects where a row should appear in the result set-this is in effect 
a delete followed by an insert-the row may not move until the result set is reopened. 
If an update causes a row to fail to qualify for membership in a result set-this is in effect
a delete-the row may remain visible until the result set is reopened. If a row is 
explicitly deleted by another transaction, a scroll-sensitive result set may maintain a 
placeholder for the row to permit logical fetching of rows by absolute position. Updated 
column values are always visible, however.
<p>
<a name="301665"></a>
The <code>DatabaseMetaData</code> interface provides a way to determine the exact capabilities 
that are supported by a result set. For example, the new methods: <code>othersUpdatesAreVisible
</code>, <code>othersDeletesAreVisible</code>, and <code>othersInsertsAreVisible</code> may be used 
for this purpose. 
<p>
<a name="301666"></a>
A forward-only result set is really a degenerate case of either a scroll-insensitive or 
scroll-sensitive result set- depending on how the DBMS evaluates the query that produces
the result set. Most DBMSs have the ability to materialize query results incrementally
for some queries. If a query result is materialized incrementally, then data 
values aren't actually retrieved until they are needed from the DBMS and the result set 
will behave like a sensitive result set. For some queries, however, incremental materialization
isn't possible. For example, if the result set is sorted, the entire result set may 
need to be produced a priori before the first row in the result set is returned to the application
by the DBMS. In this case a forward-only result set will behave like an insensitive
result set. 
<p>
<a name="301667"></a>
For a <code>TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY</code> result set the <code>othersUpdatesAreVisible</code>, <code>othersDeletesAreVisible
</code>, and <code>othersInsertsAreVisible </code>methods determine whether inserts, 
updates, and deletes are visible when the result set is materialized incrementally by the 
DBMS. If the result of a query is sorted then incremental materialization may not be 
possible and changes will not be visible, even if the methods above return true.
<p>

<a name="300962"></a>
<h4>	5.8.3	 A result set's own changes</h4>
<a name="300963"></a>
We have pointed out that the visibility of changes made by others generally depends on 
a result set's type. A final point that concerns the visibility of changes via an open result 
set is whether a result set can see its own changes (inserts, updates, and deletes). A 
JDBC technology application can determine if the changes made by a result set are visible
to the result set itself by calling the <code>DatabaseMetaData </code>methods: <code>ownUpdatesAreVisible
</code>, <code>ownDeletesAreVisible</code>, and <code>ownInsertsAreVisible</code>. These methods 
are needed since this capability can vary between DBMSs and JDBC drivers.
<p>
<a name="300964"></a>
One's own updates are visible if an updated column value can be retrieved by calling 
<code>getXXX()</code> following a call to <code>updateXXX()</code>. Updates are <strong>not</strong> visible if <code>getXXX()</code> still 
returns the initial column value after <code>updateXXX()</code> is called. Similarly, an inserted row 
is visible if it appears in the result set following a call to <code>insertRow()</code>. An inserted row 
is not visible if it does not appear in the result set immediately after <code>insertRow()</code> is 
called-without closing and reopening the result set. Deletions are visible if deleted 
rows are either removed from the result set or if deleted rows leave a <em>hole</em> in the result 
set.
<p>
<a name="300965"></a>
The following example, shows how an application may determine whether a 
<code>TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE</code> result set can see its own updates.
<p>
<blockquote><pre>DatabaseMetaData dmd;
...
if (dmd.<code>ownUpdatesAreVisible</code>(ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE)) 
{
	// changes are visible
}
</pre></blockquote><a name="300971"></a>

<p>

<a name="300977"></a>
<h4>	5.8.4	 Detecting changes</h4>
<a name="300978"></a>
The <code>ResultSet.wasUpdated()</code>, <code>wasDeleted()</code>, and <code>wasInserted()</code> methods can be 
called to determine whether a row has been effected by a visible update, delete, or insert 
respectively since the result set was opened. The ability of a result set to detect changes 
is orthogonal to its ability to make changes visible. In other words, visible changes are 
not automatically detected. 
<p>
<a name="300988"></a>
The <code>DatabaseMetaData</code> interface provides methods that allow an application to determine
whether a JDBC driver can detect changes for a particular result set type. For example,

<p>
<a name="300997"></a>

<p>
<blockquote><pre>boolean bool = dmd.deletesAreDetected(
	ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE);
</pre></blockquote><a name="300991"></a>

<p>
<a name="300996"></a>
If deletesAreDetected returns <code>true</code>, then <code>ResultSet.wasDeleted() </code>can be used to 
detect `holes' in a <code>TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE</code> result set.
<p>

<a name="302003"></a>
<h3>5.9 	  &nbsp; &nbsp; Refetching a row</h3>
<a name="302007"></a>
Some applications may need to see up-to-the-second changes that have been made to a 
row. Since a JDBC driver can do prefetching and caching of data that is read from the 
underlying database (see <code>ResultSet.setFetchSize()</code>), an application may not see 
the very latest changes that have been made to a row, even when a sensitive result set 
is used and updates are visible. The <code>ResultSet.refreshRow()</code> method is provided to 
allow an application to request that a driver refresh a row with the latest values stored 
in the database. A JDBC driver may actually refresh multiple rows at once if the fetch 
size is greater than one. Applications should exercise restraint in calling <code>refreshRow()</code>, since calling this method frequently will likely slow performance. 
<p>

<a name="282665"></a>
<h3>5.10 	  &nbsp; &nbsp; JDBC API compliance</h3>
<a name="282739"></a>
Although we expect most JDBC drivers to support scrollable result sets, we have made 
them optional to minimize the complexity of implementing JDBC drivers for data 
sources that do not support scrollability. The goal is that it be possible for a JDBC driver 
to implement scrollable result sets using the support provided by the underlying database
system for systems that have such support. If the DBMS associated with a driver 
does not support scrollability then this feature may be omitted, or a JDBC driver may 
implement scrollability as a layer on top of the DBMS. Its important to note that JDBC 
technology rowsets, which are part of the JDBC Optional Package API, always support 
scrollability, so a rowset can be used when the underlying DBMS doesn't support scrollable
results.
