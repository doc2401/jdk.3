<p>
The JDBC-ODBC Bridge allows Java programs to use JDBC with many existing
ODBC drivers. The Bridge is itself a JDBC driver defined in the class
<code>sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver</code>. The Bridge defines the JDBC
subprotocol <code>odbc</code>.
<h2>Status of the JDBC-ODBC Bridge</h2>
<p>
The JDBC-ODBC Bridge should be considered a transitional solution. Javasoft
and Intersolv are working to make the Bridge more reliable and robust, but
they do not consider it a supported product. In the near future,
development of pure-Java JDBC Drivers will make the JDBC-ODBC Bridge
unnecessary.
<h2>Why not just use ODBC?</h2>
<p>
The JDBC-ODBC Bridge offers several advantages over "naked" ODBC.
<ul>
	<li>
	The ODBC API is strongly oriented toward C/C++ programmers. The
	JDBC-ODBC Bridge makes it unnecessary for the Java programmer to
	deal with non-Java concepts.
	<p><li>
	The ODBC API is extremely complex and intermingles high-level
	and low-level functions. The JDBC-ODBC Bridge allows the
	programmer to rely on the JDBC API, which is relatively simple
	and easy to learn.
	<p><li>
	The JDBC-ODBC Bridge lets a program deal with ODBC through a
	standardized JDBC interface. That helps a program avoid being tied
	to ODBC when a better solution comes along.
</ul>
<h2>Why use ODBC at all?</h2>
<p>
The Java programmer's ideal is "Pure Java": no native code, no
platform-dependent features.
But you may need to begin your development effort right away, without
waiting for your DBMS to offer a Java-only JDBC Driver.
Partly-native Drivers, such as the JDBC-ODBC Bridge, let you create
programs that easily adapt to Pure Java drivers as they become available.
<h2>What's new with the JDBC-ODBC Bridge?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
	The Bridge has been re-implemented using the Java Native Interface
	API, for improved performance and stability.
	<p><li>
	A <code>jdbc:odbc:</code> connection can now have a
	<code>charSet</code> property, to specify a Character Encoding
	Scheme other than the client default. For possible values, see
	the <a href=http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.1/intl/html/intlspec.doc7.html#20888>
	JDK 1.1 Internationalizaton specification</a>
	on the Javasoft Web Site.
	<p><li>
	The Bridge now assumes that ODBC drivers are able to handle
	multi-threaded access. This will improve performance. If you need
	to use multi-threading and your ODBC package does not support it,
	your client program will have to implement locking.
</ul>
