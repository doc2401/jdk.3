<h2>	2	 Goals and philosophy</h2>

<a name="5443"></a>
This section outlines the main goals and philosophy driving the API design.
<p>

<a name="5445"></a>
<h3>2.1 	  &nbsp; &nbsp; A SQL level API</h3>
<a name="5446"></a>
JDBC is intended as a "call-level" SQL interface for Java. This means the focus is on executing 
raw SQL statements and retrieving their results. We expect that higher-level APIs will be defined
as well, and these will probably be implemented on top of this base level. Examples of 
higher-level APIs are direct transparent mapping of tables to Java classes, semantic tree representations
of more general queries, and an embedded SQL syntax for Java.
<p>
<a name="5447"></a>
We expect that various application builder tools will emit code that uses our API. However we 
also intend that the API be usable by human programmers, especially because there is no other 
solution available for Java right now.
<p>

<a name="11218"></a>
<h3>2.2 	  &nbsp; &nbsp; SQL Conformance</h3>
<a name="11219"></a>
Database systems support a wide range of SQL syntax and semantics, and they are not consistent
with each other on more advanced functionality such as outer joins and stored procedures. 
Hopefully with time the portion of SQL that is truly standard will expand to include more and 
more functionality. In the meantime, we take the following position:
<p>

<ul><a name="11244"></a>
<li>JDBC allows any query string to be passed through to an underlying DBMS driver, so 
an application may use as much SQL functionality as desired at the risk of receiving an 
error on some DBMSs. In fact, an application query need not even be SQL, or it may 
be a specialized derivative of SQL, e.g. for document or image queries, designed for 
specific DBMSs.
<br><br>
<a name="11251"></a>
<li>In order to pass JDBC compliance tests and to be called "JDBC COMPLIANT(TM)" we 
require that a driver support at least ANSI SQL92 Entry Level. This gives applications 
that want wide portability a guaranteed least common denominator. We believe ANSI 
SQL-2 Entry Level is reasonably powerful and is reasonably widely supported today.
<br><br>
</ul>
<a name="5448"></a>
<h3>2.3 	  &nbsp; &nbsp; JDBC must be implementable on top of common database interfaces</h3>
<a name="5449"></a>
We need to ensure that the JDBC SQL API can be implemented on top of common SQL level 
APIs, in particular ODBC. This requirement has colored some parts of the specification, notably
the handling of OUT parameters and large blobs.
<p>

<a name="8219"></a>
<h3>2.4 	  &nbsp; &nbsp; Provide a Java interface that is consistent with the rest of the Java system</h3>
<a name="8220"></a>
There has been a very strong positive response to Java. To a large extent this seems to be because
the language and the standard runtimes are perceived as being consistent, simple, and 
powerful. 
<p>
<a name="8247"></a>
As far as we can, we would like to provide a Java database interface that builds on and reinforces
the style and virtues of the existing core Java classes. 
<p>

<a name="5450"></a>
<h3>2.5 	  &nbsp; &nbsp; Keep it simple</h3>
<a name="5451"></a>
We would prefer to keep this base API as simple as possible, at least initially. In general we 
would prefer to provide a single mechanism for performing a particular task, and avoid providing
duplicate mechanisms. We will extend the API later if any important functionality is missing.

<p>

<a name="5452"></a>
<h3>2.6 	  &nbsp; &nbsp; Use strong, static typing wherever possible</h3>
<a name="5453"></a>
We would prefer that the JDBC API be strongly typed, with as much type information as possible
expressed statically. This allows for more error checking at compile time.
<p>
<a name="5455"></a>
Because SQL is intrinsically dynamically typed, we may encounter type mismatch errors at 
run-time where for example a programmer expected a SELECT to return an integer result but 
the database returned a string "foo". However we would still prefer to allow programmers to 
express their type expectations at compile time, so that we can statically check as much as possible.
We will also support dynamically typed interfaces where necessary (see particularly 
Chapter <a href="jdbc-spec.frame14.html#50686">14</a>).
<p>

<a name="5456"></a>
<h3>2.7 	  &nbsp; &nbsp; Keep the common cases simple</h3>
<a name="16217"></a>
We would like to make sure that the common cases are simple, and that the uncommon cases 
are doable. 
<p>
<a name="16118"></a>
A common case is a programmer executing a simple SQL statement (such as a SELECT, INSERT,
UPDATE or DELETE) without parameters, and then (in the case of SELECT statement)
processing rows of simple result types. A SQL statement with IN parameters is also 
common.
<p>
<a name="16213"></a>
Somewhat less common, but still important, is the case where a programmer invokes a SQL 
statement using INOUT or OUT parameters. We also need to support SQL statements that read 
or write multi-megabyte objects, and less common cases such as multiple result sets returned 
by a SQL statement.
<p>
<a name="2414"></a>
We expect that metadata access (e.g. to discover result-set types, or to enumerate the procedures
in a database) is comparatively rare and is mostly used by sophisticated programmers or 
by builder tools. Metadata functions are therefore documented at the end of the specification, 
along with dynamically-typed data access; the average programmer can skip these sections.
<p>

<a name="16214"></a>
<h3>2.8 	  &nbsp; &nbsp; Use multiple methods to express multiple functionality</h3>
<a name="5464"></a>
One style of interface design is to use a very small number of procedures and offer a large number
of control flags as arguments to these procedures, so that they can be used to effect a wide 
range of different behavior.<em>
</em><p>
<a name="5466"></a>
In general the philosophy of the Java core classes has been to use different methods to express 
different functionality. This tends to lead to a larger number of methods, but makes each method
easier to understand. This approach has the major advantage that programmers who are 
learning how to use the basic interface aren't confused by having to specify arguments related 
to more complex behaviors.
<p>
<a name="5467"></a>
We've tried to adopt the same approach for the JDBC interface, and in general have preferred 
to use multiple methods rather than using multi-purpose methods with flag arguments.
