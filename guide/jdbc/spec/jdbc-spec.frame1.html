<h2>	1	 Introduction</h2>

<a name="472"></a>
Many vendors and customers are now looking for easy database access for Java applications. 
Since Java is robust, secure, easy to use, easy to understand, and automatically downloadable 
on a network, it is an excellent language basis for the development of database applications. It 
offers many advantages over C, C++, Smalltalk, BASIC, COBOL, and 4GLs for a wide variety 
of uses.  
<p>
<a name="15319"></a>
Many Java application developers would like to write code that is independent of the particular 
DBMS or database connectivity mechanism being used, and we believe that a DBMS-independent
interface is also the fastest way to implement access to the wide variety of DBMSs. So, 
we decided it would be useful to the Java community to define a generic SQL database access 
framework which provides a uniform interface on top of a variety of different database connectivity
modules. This allows programmers to write to a single database interface, enables 
DBMS-independent Java application development tools and products, and allows database 
connectivity vendors to provide a variety of different connectivity solutions.
<p>
<a name="4907"></a>
Our immediate priority has been to define a common low-level API that supports basic SQL 
functionality. We call this API JDBC.  This API in turn allows the development of higher-level 
database access tools and APIs.
<p>
<a name="4914"></a>
Fortunately we didn't need to design a SQL API from scratch. We based our work on the 
X/Open SQL CLI (Call Level Interface) which is also the basis for Microsoft's ODBC interface.
Our main task has been defining a natural Java interface to the basic abstractions and concepts
defined in the X/Open CLI.
<p>
<a name="5476"></a>
It is important that the JDBC API be accepted by database vendors, connectivity vendors, ISVs, 
and application writers. We believe that basing our work on the ODBC abstractions is likely to 
make this acceptance easier, and technically ODBC seems a good basis for our design. 
<p>
<a name="5667"></a>
ODBC is not appropriate for direct use from Java, since it is a C interface; calls from Java to 
native C code have a number of drawbacks in the security, implementation, robustness, and automatic
portability of applications. Thus, we have constructed an API that can easily be implemented
on top of ODBC short-term, and that can be implemented in other ways longer term.

<h3>1.1 	  &nbsp; &nbsp; Acknowledgments</h3>
<a name="45212"></a>
We would like to thank the many reviewers in the database, database connectivity, and database
tools communities who gave generously of their time and expertise. 
<p>
<a name="45239"></a>
We are grateful to all the reviewers who took the time to read and comment on the various 
drafts, but we would particularly like to thank Azad Bolour, Paul Cotton, Ed Garon, John 
Goodson, Mark Hapner, Tommy Hawkins, Karl Moss, and Barbara Walters for providing sustained
review and helpful feedback over many drafts and revisions of the API.
<p>
<a name="45211"></a>
The errors and omissions that remain, are however, all our own work.
