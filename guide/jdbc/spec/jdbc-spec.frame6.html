<h2>	6	 Database connections</h2>

For the full interface descriptions see the Java interfaces in Chapter <a href="jdbc-spec.frame13.html#4165">13</a>.
<p>

<h3>6.1 	  &nbsp; &nbsp; Opening a connection</h3>
<a name="4694"></a>
When you want to access a database, you may obtain a java.sql.Connection object from the 
JDBC management layer's java.sql.DriverManager.getConnection method.
<p>
<a name="16343"></a>
The DriverManager.getConnection method takes a URL string as an argument. The JDBC 
management layer will attempt to locate a driver that can connect to the database represented 
by the URL. The JDBC management layer does this by asking each driver in turn (see Section 
<a href="jdbc-spec.frame6.html#16326">6.2</a> below) if it can connect to the given URL.<a href="#25398"><sup>1</sup></a> Drivers should examine the URL to see if it 
specifies a subprotocol that they support (see Section <a href="jdbc-spec.frame6.html#16290">6.3</a> below), and if so, they should attempt 
to connect to the specified database. If they succeed in establishing a connection, then they 
should return an appropriate java.sql.Connection object.
<p>
<a name="16314"></a>
From the java.sql.Connection object it is possible to obtain java.sql.Statement, java.sql.PreparedStatement
, and java.sql.CallableStatement objects that can be used to execute SQL statement
s.
<p>
<a name="8410"></a>
We also permit applications to bypass the JDBC management layer during connection open 
and explicitly select and use a particular driver.
<p>

<a name="16326"></a>
<h3>6.2 	  &nbsp; &nbsp; Choosing between drivers</h3>
<a name="16330"></a>
It may sometimes be the case that several JDBC drivers are capable of connecting to a given 
URL. For example, when connecting to a given remote database it might be possible to use either
a JDBC-ODBC bridge driver, or a JDBC to generic network protocol driver, or to use a 
driver supplied by the database vendor.
<p>
<a name="16331"></a>
JDBC allows users to specify a driver list by setting a Java property "jdbc.drivers". If this property
is defined,then it should be a colon separated list of driver class names, such as "acme.wonder.Driver
:foobaz.openNet.Driver:vendor.OurDriver".
<p>
<a name="16358"></a>
When searching for a driver, JDBC will use the first driver it finds that can successfully connect 
to the given URL. It will first try to use each of the drivers specified in the sql.drivers list, in 
the order given. It will then proceed to try to use each loaded driver in the order in which the 
drivers were loaded. It will skip any drivers which are untrusted code, unless they have been 
loaded from the same source as the code that is trying to open the connection (see the security 
discussion in Section <a href="jdbc-spec.frame5.html#4985">5</a>).
<p>

<a name="16290"></a>
<h3>6.3 	  &nbsp; &nbsp; URLs</h3>

<a name="8149"></a>
<h4>	6.3.1	 Goals for JDBC database naming</h4>
<a name="16549"></a>
We need to provide a way of naming databases so that application writers can specify which 
database they wish to connect to.
<p>
<a name="16427"></a>
We would like this JDBC naming mechanism to have the following properties:
<p>
<a name="16428"></a>
<li>Different drivers can use different schemes for naming databases. For example, a 
JDBC-ODBC bridge driver may support simple ODBC style data source names, 
whereas a network protocol driver may need to know additional information so it can 
discover which hostname and port to connect to.

<a name="16441"></a>
<li>If a user downloads an applet that wants to talk to a given database then we would like 
to be able to open a database connection without requiring the user to do any system 
administration chores. Thus for example, we want to avoid requiring an analogue of the 
human-administered ODBC data source tables on the client machines. This implies that 
it should be possible to encode any necessary connection information in the JDBC 
name.

<a name="16461"></a>
<li>We would like to allow a level of indirection in the JDBC name, so that the initial name 
may be resolved via some network naming system in order to locate the database. This 
will allow system administrators to avoid specifying particular hosts as part of the 
JDBC name. However, since there are a number of different network name services 
(such as NIS, DCE, etc.) we do not wish to mandate that any particular network 
nameserver is used.


<a name="16429"></a>
<h4>	6.3.2	 URL syntax</h4>
<a name="16550"></a>
Fortunately the World Wide Web has already standardized on a naming system that supports 
all of these properties. This is the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) mechanism. So we propose
to use URLs for JDBC naming, and merely recommend some conventions for structuring 
JDBC URLs.
<p>
<a name="16555"></a>
We recommend that JDBC URL's be structured as:
<p>
<a name="16556"></a>
			jdbc:&lt;subprotocol&gt;:&lt;subname&gt;
<p>
<a name="16557"></a>
where a subprotocol names a particular kind of database connectivity mechanism that may be 
supported by one or more drivers. The contents and syntax of the subname will depend on the 
subprotocol.
<p>
<a name="16562"></a>
If you are specifying a network address as part of your subname, we recommend following the 
standard URL naming convention of "//hostname:port/subsubname" for the subname. The subsubname
can have arbitrary internal syntax. 
<p>

<a name="16551"></a>
<h4>	6.3.3	 Example URLs</h4>
<a name="16506"></a>
For example, in order to access a database through a JDBC-ODBC bridge, one might use a 
URL like:
<p>
<a name="16507"></a>
			jdbc:odbc:fred
<p>
<a name="16508"></a>
In this example the subprotocol is "odbc" and the subname is a local ODBC data source name 
"fred". A JDBC-ODBC driver can check for URLs that have subprotocol "odbc" and then use 
the subname in an ODBC SQLConnect.
<p>
<a name="16509"></a>
If you are using some generic database connectivity protocol "dbnet" to talk to a database listener
, you might have a URL like:
<p>
<a name="16529"></a>
			jdbc:dbnet://wombat:356/fred
<p>
<a name="30804"></a>
In this example the URL specifies that we should use the "dbnet" protocol to connect to port 
356 on host wombat and then present the subsubname "fred" to that port to locate the final database.

<p>
<a name="16530"></a>
If you wish to use some network name service to provide a level of indirection in database 
names, then we recommend using the name of the naming service as the subprotocol. So for 
example one might have a URL like:
<p>
<a name="16531"></a>
			jdbc:dcenaming:accounts-payable
<p>
<a name="16583"></a>
In this example, the URL specifies that we should use the local DCE naming service to resolve 
the database name "accounts-payable" into a more specific name that can be used to connect 
to the real database. In some situations, it might be appropriate to provide a pseudo driver that 
performed a name lookup via a network name server and then used the resulting information 
to locate the real driver and do the real connection open.
<p>

<a name="16584"></a>
<h4>	6.3.4	 Drivers can choose a syntax and ignore other URLs.</h4>
<a name="16919"></a>
In summary, the JDBC URL mechanism is intended to provide a framework so that different 
drivers can use different naming systems that are appropriate to their needs. Each driver need 
only understand a single URL naming syntax, and can happily reject any other URLs that it 
encounters.
<p>

<a name="11833"></a>
<h4>	6.3.5	 Registering subprotocol names</h4>
<a name="11834"></a>
JavaSoft will act as an informal registry for JDBC sub-protocol names. Send mail to jdbc@wombat.eng.sun.com
to reserve a sub-protocol name.
<p>

<a name="25343"></a>
<h4>	6.3.6	 The "odbc" subprotocol</h4>
<a name="25352"></a>
The "odbc" subprotocol has been reserved for URLs that specify ODBC style Data Source 
Names. For this subprotocol we specify a URL syntax that allows arbitrary attribute values to 
be specified after the data source name.
<p>
<a name="25356"></a>
The full odbc subprotocol URL syntax is:
<p>
<pre><code>jdbc:odbc:&lt;<em>data-source-name</em>&gt;[;&lt;<em>attribute-name</em>&gt;=&lt;<em>attribute-value</em>&gt;]*
</code></pre>
<a name="25359"></a>
Thus valid jdbc:odbc names include:
<p>
<pre><code>jdbc:odbc:qeor7
</code></pre>
<pre><code>jdbc:odbc:wombat
</code></pre>
<pre><code>jdbc:odbc:wombat;CacheSize=20;ExtensionCase=LOWER
</code></pre>
<pre><code>jdbc:odbc:qeora;UID=kgh;PWD=fooey
</code></pre>
<pre><code>
</code></pre>

<a name="25353"></a>
<h3>6.4 	  &nbsp; &nbsp; Connection arguments</h3>
<a name="16925"></a>
When opening a connection, you can pass in a java.util.Properties object. This object is a property
set that maps between tag strings and value strings. Two conventional properties are "user" 
and "password". Particular drivers may specify and use other properties.
<p>
<a name="16935"></a>
In order to allow applets to access databases in a generic way, we recommend that as much connection
information as possible be encoded as part of the URL and that driver writers minimize 
their use of property sets.
<p>

<a name="16922"></a>
<h3>6.5 	  &nbsp; &nbsp; Multiple connections</h3>
<a name="16913"></a>
A single application can maintain multiple database connections to one or more databases, using
one or more drivers.
<p>

<a name="4731"></a>
<h3>6.6 	  &nbsp; &nbsp; Registering drivers</h3>
<a name="4732"></a>
The JDBC management layer needs to know which database drivers are available. We provide 
two ways of doing this.
<p>
<a name="4736"></a>
First, when the JDBC java.sql.DriverManager class initializes it will look for a "sql.drivers" 
property in the system properties. If the property exists it should consist of a colon-separated 
list of driver class names. Each of the named classes should implement the java.sql.Driver interface.
The DriverManager class will attempt to load each named Driver class.
<p>
<a name="20304"></a>
Second, a programmer can explicitly load a driver class using the standard Class.forName 
method. For example, to load the acme.db.Driver class you might do:
<p>
<pre><code>Class.forName("acme.db.Driver");
</code></pre>
<pre><code>
</code></pre>
<a name="20296"></a>
In both cases it is the responsibility of each newly loaded Driver class to register itself with the 
DriverManager, using the DriverManager.registerDriver method. This will allow the DriverManager
to use the driver when it is attempting to make database connections.
<p>
<a name="4751"></a>
For security reasons the JDBC management layer will keep track of which class loader provided
which driver and when opening connections it will only use drivers that come from the local 
filesystem or from the same classloader as the code issuing the getConnection request.
<p>

<sup>1</sup><a name="25398"></a>
 At first glance this may seem inefficient, but keep in mind that this requires only a few procedure calls and string 
comparisons per connection since it is unlikely that dozens of drivers will concurrently be loaded.
