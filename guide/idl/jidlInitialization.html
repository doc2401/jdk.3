<!--************CREATING AN ORB OBJECT**********-->

<A NAME="creatingorb">
<H2>Creating an ORB Object</H2></A>

<P>Before it can create or invoke a CORBA object, an applet or
application must first create an ORB object. Doing so introduces the
applet or application to the ORB and obtains access to important
operations that are defined on the ORB object.</P>

<P>Applets and applications create ORB instances slightly
differently, because their parameters, which must be passed in the
<TT>ORB.init()</TT> call, are arranged differently.</P>


<A NAME="orbsforapps">
<H3>Creating an ORB for an Application</H3></A>

<P>This fragment shows how an application might create an ORB:</P>

<PRE>    import org.omg.CORBA.ORB;
&nbsp;
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
      try{
        ORB orb = ORB.init(args, null); 
    // code continues
</PRE>


<A NAME="orbsforapplets">
<H3>Creating an ORB for an Applet</H3></A>

<P>An applet creates an ORB like this:</P>

<PRE>
    import org.omg.CORBA.ORB;
&nbsp;
    public void init() {
      try {
        ORB orb = ORB.init(this, null);
    // code continues
</PRE>


<P>Some web browsers have an ORB built directly into them.  This can cause
problems if that ORB is not perfectly compliant. In this case, special steps 
must be taken to initialize the Java&nbsp;IDL ORB specifically.  
For example, because of 
missing classes in the installed ORB in Netscape Communicator&nbsp;4.01, 
an applet displayed in that browser must contain code similar to the
following in its <TT>init()</TT> method:

<PRE>
    import java.util.Properties;
    import org.omg.CORBA.*;

    public class MyApplet extends java.applet.Applet {
      public void init()
      {
        // Instantiate the Java IDL ORB, passing in this applet 
        // so that the ORB can retrieve the applet properties.
        Properties props = new Properties();
        props.put("org.omg.CORBA.ORBClass", "com.sun.CORBA.iiop.ORB");
        ORB orb = ORB.init(this, props);
        ...
      }
    }
&nbsp;</PRE>  


<A NAME="initargs">
<H3>Arguments to ORB.init()</H3>

<P>For both applications and applets, the arguments for the initialization 
method are:

<DL>
<DT><B>args</B> or <B>this</B>
<DD>Provides the ORB access to the application's arguments or 
applet's parameters.
<DT><B>null</B>
<DD>A <TT>java.util.Properties</TT> object.
</DL>

<P>The <TT>init()</TT> operation uses these parameters, as well as the
system properties, to obtain information it needs to configure
the ORB. It searches for ORB configuration
properties in the following places and order:</P>

<OL>
   <LI>The application or applet parameters (first argument)
   
   <LI>A <TT>java.util.Properties</TT> object (second argument), if one has been
   supplied
   
   <LI>The <TT>java.util.Properties</TT> object returned by 
   <TT>System.getProperties()</TT>
</OL>

<P>The first value found for a particular property is the value the
<TT>init()</TT> operation uses. If a configuration property cannot be
found in any of these places, the <TT>init()</TT> operation assumes
an implementation-specific value for it. For maximum portability
among ORB implementations, applets and applications should explicitly
specify configuration property values that affect their operation,
rather than relying on the assumptions of the ORB they happen to be
running in.</P>


<A NAME="systempropertiesobject">
<H3>System Properties</H3></A>

<P>With respect to the system <TT>Properties</TT> object, note that Sun's Java
virtual machine<B>*</B> adds <TT>-D</TT> command line arguments to it.  
Other Java virtual machines may or may not do the same.</P>

<P>Currently, the following configuration properties are defined for all
ORB implementations:</P>

<DL>
   <DT><TT>org.omg.CORBA.ORBClass</TT>
   
   <DD>The name of a Java class that implements the
   <TT>org.omg.CORBA.ORB</TT> interface. Applets and applications do not
   need to supply this property unless they must have a particular
   ORB implementation. The value for the Java&nbsp;IDL ORB is
   <TT>com.sun.CORBA.iiop.ORB</TT>.
   
   <DT><TT>org.omg.CORBA.ORBSingletonClass</TT>
   
   <DD>The name of a Java class that implements the
   <TT>org.omg.CORBA.ORB</TT> interface. This is the object returned
   by a call to <TT>orb.init()</TT> with no arguments. It is used primarily to 
   create typecode instances than can be shared across untrusted code (such as
   unsigned applets) in a secured environment. 
  
</DL>

<P>In addition to the standard properties listed above, Java&nbsp;IDL
also supports the following properties:</P>

<DL>
   <DT><A NAME="orbhost"></A><TT>org.omg.CORBA.ORBInitialHost</TT>
   
   <DD>The host name of a machine running a server or daemon that provides
   initial bootstrap services, such as a name service. The default value for
   this property is <TT>localhost</TT> for applications. For applets
   it is the applet host, equivalent to
   <TT>getCodeBase().getHost()</TT>.
   
   <DT><TT><A NAME="orbport"></A>org.omg.CORBA.ORBInitialPort</TT>
   
   <DD>The port the initial naming service listens to. The default
   value is <TT>900</TT>.
   
</DL>

<P><HR>
<B>Note:</B> When specifying a property as a command-line argument to a Java&nbsp;IDL 
application, omit the <TT>org.omg.CORBA.</TT> portion of 
the property name.  For 
example, a command line that starts an application looks like this:  
<PRE>
    -ORBInitialPort 800
</PRE>
<P>Applet parameters should specify the full property names.  The 
conventions for applications differ from applets so as not to expose 
language-specific details in command-line invocations. 
<HR></P>


<!--***************INITIAL OBJREFS******************-->

<A name="obtaininginitial">
<H2>Obtaining Initial Object References</H2></A>

<P>To invoke a CORBA object, an applet or application must have a
reference for it. There are three ways to get a reference for a CORBA
object:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>From a string that was specially created from an object
   reference
   
   <LI>From another object, such as a naming context
   <LI>From the <TT>ORB</TT> operation <TT>resolve_initial_references()</TT>
</UL>


<A name="stringifiedobjref">
<H3>Stringified Object References</H3></A>

<P>The first technique, converting a stringified reference to an
actual object reference, is ORB-implementation independent. No matter
what Java ORB an applet or application runs on, it can convert a
stringified object reference. However, it is up to the applet or
application developer to: </P>

<UL>
   <LI>Ensure that the object referred to is in fact accessible from
   where the applet or application is running. 
   
   <LI>Obtain the stringified reference, perhaps from a file or a
   parameter.
</UL>

<P>The following fragment shows how a server converts a CORBA object 
reference to a string:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
org.omg.CORBA.ORB orb =    // get an ORB object
org.omg.CORBA.Object obj = // create the object reference
String str = orb.object_to_string(obj);
// make the string available to the client
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This code fragment shows how a client converts the stringified
object reference back to an object:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
org.omg.CORBA.ORB orb =    // get an ORB object
String stringifiedref =    // read string
org.omg.CORBA.Object obj = orb.string_to_object(stringifiedref);
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>


<A name="gettingobjref">
<H3>Getting References from an ORB</H3></A>

<P>If you don't use a stringified reference to get an initial CORBA
object, you use the ORB itself to produce an initial object
reference. However, doing so may make your applet or application
ORB-dependent, because, although the CORBA specification defines the
interface for getting initial object references, it doesn't yet
provide enough information for ORB vendors to implement it
in a standard way. Applet and application developers should therefore be
cautious when using this operation until the standard is more tightly
specified. To <I>guarantee</I> ORB-implementation-independence, use
the stringified object reference technique instead.</P>

<P>The ORB interface defines an operation called
<TT>resolve_initial_references()</TT> that is intended for
bootstrapping object references into a newly started application or
applet. The operation takes a string argument that names one of a few
recognized objects; it returns a CORBA Object, which must be narrowed
to the type the applet or application knows it to be. Two string
values are presently defined:</P>

<DL>
   <DT><TT>NameService</TT>
   
   <DD>Passing this value returns a reference to a root
   <A HREF="jidlNaming.html#nameserver">naming context</A> which, after narrowing,
   can be used to look up references for objects whose names are known
   to the applet or application (assuming those objects are
   registered by those names in the root or subordinate naming
   contexts).
   
   <DT><TT>InterfaceRepository</TT>
   
   <DD>This value returns a reference to an interface repository, a
   CORBA object that contains interface definitions.  The current release of
   Java&nbsp;IDL does not include an implementation of the interface
   repository.  If you are using another server-side orb, you can still
   use "InterfaceRepository" as the argument to <TT>resolve_initial_references()</TT>.
</DL>

<P>The Java&nbsp;IDL implementation of
<TT>resolve_initial_references()</TT> requires an already-running
naming service whose host and port are identified by the
<TT><A HREF="#orbhost">ORBInitialHost</A></TT> and
<TT><A HREF="#orbport">ORBInitialPort</A></TT> properties described
previously, or by their default values. 
See <A HREF="jidlNaming.html#startingnameserver">Naming Service</A> 
for details on starting the Java&nbsp;IDL name server.</P>
