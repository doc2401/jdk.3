<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Java IDL: The "Hello World" Example on 2 machines</H1>


<P>To enable the Hello World Tutorial to run on two machines, follow the steps as directed 
in the <a href="../GShome.html">tutorial</a>, with the following changes.  This tutorial 
was written for the Java (tm) 2 Platform, Standard Edition (J2Se(tm)), version 1.3.  In 
this example, the client, stubs, and skeletons are located on the client machine, and the 
server and name server are located on the server machine.  This scenario can be changed to 
meet your needs and is provided simply as an introduction to one way this can be 
accomplished.

<OL>
<LI>Create and compile the <TT>Hello.idl</TT> file on the client machine as indicated in 
the tutorial:
<P>
<PRE>   
   idlj -fall Hello.idl
</PRE>
<P>
<LI>Create HelloClient.java on the client machine.  Compile the <TT>.java</TT> files, 
including the stubs and skeletons (which are in the directory <TT>HelloApp</TT>):
<PRE>
   javac *.java HelloApp/*.java
</PRE>
<P>
<LI>Create HelloServer.java on the server machine.  Compile the <TT>.java</TT> files:
<PRE>
   javac *.java
</PRE>
<P>
<LI>Start the Java IDL name server on the server machine.  To do this on Unix:
   
<PRE>
   tnameserv -ORBInitialPort 1050&
</PRE>
<P>To do this on Windows:
<PRE>
   start tnameserv -ORBInitialPort 1050
</PRE>
   
 <P>Note that the name server will run on port <TT>1050</TT> if you enter the command as 
listed.  If you want a different <em>nameserverport</em>, replace 1050 with the correct 
port number. 
<P>
<LI>On the server machine, start the Hello server, as follows:
<PRE>
   java HelloServer  -ORBInitialPort 1050
</PRE>
<P>If you used a different <em>nameserverport</em>, replace 1050 with the correct port 
number. 
<P>
<LI>On the client machine, run the Hello application client.  From a DOS prompt or shell, 
type:<P>
<PRE>
   java HelloClient  -ORBInitialHost <em>namerserverhost</em> -ORBInitialPort 1050
</PRE>


<P>Note that <em>nameserverhost</em> is the host on which the IDL name server is running.  
In this case, it is the server machine.  

<P>If you used a different <em>nameserverport</em>, replace 1050 with the correct port 
number.
<P>
<LI>Kill or stop the server process when finished.
