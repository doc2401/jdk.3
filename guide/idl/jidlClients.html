<!--*******ORBS AND INVOCATIONS********-->

<A name="orbsandinvocations">
<H2>ORBs and Invocations</H3></A>

<P>For a client to invoke a CORBA object operation, both the client
and the server (the object implementation) must use a CORBA software
component called an ORB (object request broker). ORBs are the common
denominators that bridge the differences in location, platform, and
programming language that can separate a client and a server. ORBs
can contact each other across the network, can create and interpret
object references (CORBA object handles), and can marshal parameters
into and out of the format used by IIOP. In addition to enabling
client/server communication, ORBs provide other services, but they
are not described here.</P>

<P>The two ways to invoke an operation on a CORBA object are: </P>

<UL>
   <LI><I><A HREF="#staticinvoke">Static invocation</A></I>, 
   which is used most often and most resembles
   conventional Java programming, is type-checked by the compiler.
   But it can only be used for objects whose interface definitions
   exist when the invoking client is compiled. <P>
   
   <LI><I><A HREF="#DynamicInvocation">Dynamic invocation</A></I> is more
   flexible because clients can invoke objects they discover at
   runtime. However, compile-time type-checking is impossible with
   dynamic invocation. Although it's possible to type-check
   parameters at runtime, doing so requires a CORBA Interface
   Repository, which the current release of Java&nbsp;IDL does not
   provide. 
</UL>


<!--*******STATIC INVOCATION********-->

<A name="staticinvoke">
<H2>Static Invocation</H2></A>

<P>To make a static invocation on a CORBA object, a Java client
needs an object reference to the servant that performs the operation. The 
object reference has two important functions:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>It uniquely identifies the servant, wherever it is located.<P>
   
   <LI>It implements the client stub interface, making the reference a local
   proxy for the servant object.
</UL>

</P>Clients don't create object references but 
<A HREF="jidlUsingCORBA.html#third">obtain them</A>, 
typically from other objects such as factories or 
<A href="jidlNaming.html">naming</A> contexts.

<P>OMG IDL is the language in which CORBA object interfaces are
defined. For each OMG IDL module, the <TT>idlj</TT> compiler
generates a Java package. For each interface <CODE>Foo</CODE> defined
in an OMG IDL module, the generated package contains the following
items of interest to the client programmer:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>A Java <em>signature</em> interface <CODE>Foo</CODE>, which extends <TT>org.omg.portable.IDLEntity</TT>, <TT>org.omg.CORBA.Object</TT>, and the operations interface.  The signature interface is used as the signature type in method declarations when interfaces of the specified type are used in other interfaces. From the client's point
   of view, an object reference for a CORBA <CODE>Foo</CODE> object
   implements this interface.<P>
   
   <P>Note:  The Stub implements the <CODE>Foo</CODE> interface, where it
generates code for each method to marshall the arguments,
invoke the method, and then unmarshall the arguments.<P>

   <LI>A Java <em>operations</em> interface <CODE>FooOperations</CODE>, which is used in the server-side mapping and as a mechanism for providing optimized calls for co-located clients and server.   The server developer provides implementation for the methods indicated by the operations interface.
<P>
   
   <LI>A Java class <CODE>FooHelper</CODE>, that defines auxiliary
   methods, notably <CODE>narrow()</CODE>, which is the CORBA
   counterpart of Java casting.<P>
   
   <LI>A Java class called <TT>FooHolder</TT>, that holds a public 
   <TT>Foo</TT> member. Holders are
   required for CORBA operations that take <TT>out</TT> or
   <TT>inout</TT> arguments, which, unlike CORBA <TT>in</TT>
   arguments, don't map directly to Java's pass-by-value semantics.
</UL>

<P>Here's a simple example from the point of view of a client.  The full text of the generated files can  be viewed from <A HREF="jidlSampleCode.html">Sample Code for Example.idl</A>.  </P>

<P>The following Java fragment shows the essentials of declaring and
invoking an instance of this CORBA object:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>import Example.*     // get the interface and helper 
&nbsp;
Counter anInstance = // <A HREF="jidlUsingCORBA.html#third">acquire a reference</A>
&nbsp;
boolean aResult; 
int anArg = 10;
&nbsp;
aResult = anInstance.increment(anArg);</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>A <I>stub</I> adapts a client to its underlying ORB for a particular
CORBA object type. The ORB knows how to marshal an argument, but not
which arguments need marshaling for a particular method. The stub,
being type-specific, knows which arguments need marshaling for each
method. When a client invokes a stub method, the stub tells the
client's ORB what to marshal, and then tells the ORB to invoke the
CORBA object identified by the object reference. The client's ORB
uses the object reference to determine which remote ORB should
receive the invocation, passes the marshaled parameters over the
network to that ORB, and waits for the result. (For those familiar
with remote procedure calls, CORBA object invocation is similar.)
</P>

<P>A <I>skeleton</I> is an object server's analog of the client's stub.
Skeletons are also generated by IDL compilers. When an ORB receives
an invocation for one of its objects, processing is as follows:

<OL>
<LI>The ORB inspects the object key from the incoming message to learn
the identity of the object's servant. Actually, the object reference contains the object key, and according to the IIOP protocol specified by the OMG, only the object key part  of the object reference flows as part of the message.
<LI>The ORB then invokes the appropriate skeleton, which tells the ORB 
how to unmarshal the parameters.
<LI>The ORB invokes the servant implementation of the
operation requested by the client.
<LI>The servant method returns a result to the skeleton. 
<LI>The skeleton arranges marshaling with the server ORB.
<LI>The server ORB returns the result to the client ORB. 
<LI>The client ORB returns the result to the stub.
<LI>The stub returns the result to the client.
</OL>

<P>To summarize, IIOP ORBs communicate CORBA object invocations
across a network in a standardized form. All ORB
operations are independent of the type of object being invoked and of 
the language in which the client and server are written. It's the job
of the stub and the skeleton to match clients and servers to their ORBs
for a particular type of CORBA object.</P>


<!--*******DYNAMIC INVOCATION********-->

<A NAME="DynamicInvocation">
<H2>Dynamic Invocation</H2></A>

<P>CORBA dynamic invocation uses an object called a <I>request</I> to
hold everything pertinent to an invocation: the object reference, the
name of the operation, its parameters, and space for the result. The
client builds a request object describing an operation, then calls
the request's <CODE>invoke</CODE> method, which dispatches the
request just as a stub would. When the invoke method returns, the
result is available in the request object.</P>

<P>The key to dynamic invocation is the ability of requests to hold
self-describing data. This facility enables a request object to
represent any invocation of any operation, regardless of its
parameters. Each self-describing data element has a special type
known in OMG IDL as <CODE>Any</CODE>. An <CODE>Any</CODE> consists of
a typecode (whose values are defined by OMG IDL) and a value; the
typecode specifies the type of the value.</P>

<P>The following example shows the essentials of dynamic invocation.
The CORBA object to be invoked has the following OMG IDL interface
definition:</P>

<PRE>
import org.omg.CosNaming.*;
import org.omg.CORBA.*;

public class CounterClient {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    try{
      // create and initialize the ORB
      ORB orb = ORB.init(args, null);

      // get the root naming context
      org.omg.CORBA.Object objRef = 
		orb.resolve_initial_references("NameService");
      NamingContext ncRef = NamingContextHelper.narrow(objRef);
 
      // resolve the Object Reference in Naming
      NameComponent nc = new NameComponent("Counter", "");
      NameComponent path[] = {nc};
      Counter counterRef = CounterHelper.narrow(ncRef.resolve(path));

      System.out.println("Object Ref: " + orb.object_to_string(counterRef));

      // Create a DII request and set the arguments and result
      org.omg.CORBA.Request r = counterRef._request("increment");
      r.set_return_type(orb.get_primitive_tc(org.omg.CORBA.TCKind.tk_long));
      org.omg.CORBA.Any inc = r.add_in_arg();
      inc.insert_long(1); // increment by 1

      for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        // call the Hello server object and print results
	r.invoke();
	java.lang.Exception ex = r.env().exception();
        if (ex instanceof org.omg.CORBA.UnknownUserException) {
          org.omg.CORBA.UnknownUserException userEx = 
		  (org.omg.CORBA.UnknownUserException) ex;
        }
	
	// extract the result
        int result;
	result = r.return_value().extract_long();
	System.out.println("Counter: " + result);
      }

    } catch (Exception e) {
      System.out.println("CounterClient : Exception: " + e) ;
      e.printStackTrace(System.out);
    }
  }
}
</PRE>


<!--****************INITIALIZING APPLETS**************-->

<A name="otherorbs">
<H2>Initializing Applets</H2></A>

<P>Some web browsers have an ORB built directly into them.  This can cause
problems if that ORB is not perfectly compliant. In this case, special steps 
must be taken to initialize the Java&nbsp;IDL ORB specifically.  
For example, because of 
missing classes in the installed ORB in Netscape Communicator&nbsp;4.01, 
an applet displayed in that browser must contain code similar to the
following in its <TT>init()</TT> method:

<PRE>
    import java.util.Properties;
    import org.omg.CORBA.*;

    public class MyApplet extends java.applet.Applet {
      public void init()
      {
        // Instantiate the Sun ORB, passing in this applet 
        // so that the ORB can retrieve the applet properties.
        Properties props = new Properties();
        props.put("org.omg.CORBA.ORBClass", "com.sun.CORBA.iiop.ORB");
        ORB orb = ORB.init(this, props);
        ...
      }
    }
&nbsp;</PRE>
