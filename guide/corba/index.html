<H1>CORBA Technology and the Java<SUP><FONT SIZE="-2">TM</FONT></SUP>
Platform</H1> </P>



<P>The Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition, v1.3, provides a CORBA 
 Object Request Broker (ORB) and two CORBA programming 
models that utilize the Java CORBA ORB and Internet InterORB Protocol 
(IIOP).  This topic discusses these options for creating and 
distributing CORBA technology.

<P>CORBA technology is an integral part of the Java 2 platform.  It 
consists of an <A HREF="#orb">Object Request Broker (ORB)</A> written 
in Java (with a small bit of native code), APIs for the <A HREF="#rmi">RMI 
programming model</A>, and APIs for the <A HREF="#idl">IDL programming model</A>. 
 </P> 


<H2>How does J2SE leverage CORBA</H2>

<P>Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) technology is the
open standard for heterogeneous computing.  CORBA complements the
Java<SUP><FONT SIZE="-2">TM</FONT></SUP> platform by providing a
distributed objects framework, services to support that framework, and
interoperability with other languages.  The Java platform complements 
CORBA
by providing "Write Once, Run Anywhere<SUP><FONT 
SIZE="-2">TM</FONT></SUP>"
portability, a highly productive implementation environment, and a very
robust platform.  By combining the Java platform with CORBA and other 
key
enterprise technologies, the Java 2 Platform is the ultimate platform 
for
distributed technology solutions.  </P> 

<P> CORBA standards provide the
proven, interoperable infrastructure to the Java platform.  IIOP 
(Internet
Inter-ORB Protocol) manages the communication between the object 
components
that power the system.  The Java platform provides a portable object
infrastructure that works on every major operating system.  CORBA 
provides
the network transparency, Java provides the implementation 
transparency.

<H3>The Object Request Broker?</H3>

<P>A CORBA  <A
HREF="../../api/org/omg/CORBA/package-summary.html">Object Request 
Broker
(ORB)</A> is part of the Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition, v1.3.  The ORB is a 
runtime component that can be used for distributed 
computing using IIOP communication.   This eliminates the requirement for 
licensing and distributing third-party Java ORBs.

<P><STRONG>NOTE: Although it is true in theory that ORBs written in 
different languages should be able to talk to each other, we haven't tested the 
interoperability of the Java ORB with other vendor's ORBs.</STRONG>

<P> The Object Management Group (OMG) is an industry consortium that
invented CORBA and publishes specifications for CORBA.  Vendors 
implement
the specifications to produce products known as Object Request Brokers
(ORB).  The good news for developers is that the Java<sup><font
size="-2">TM</font></sup> Standard Edition, v1.2 and higher includes an
 ORB that is available in every deployment of the Java 
2
Platform, Standard and Enterprise Editions.  Now you can write Java 
CORBA
code without having to license any other software!  To read more about 
the
<A HREF="../../api/org/omg/CORBA/ORB.html"><TT>ORB</TT></A> class,

the link.

<P>The Java CORBA ORB supports both the RMI and IDL programming models, 
both of which use the underlying IIOP wire-level protocol for 
communication.

<H2>Introducing the CORBA Programming Models</H2>



<H3>History of the CORBA Programming Models</H3>

    

<P>In 1997, Remote Method Invocation, or RMI, was introduced in JDK 
1.1.  Initially, RMI was positioned as a natural outgrowth of Remote 
Procedure Calls (RPC), strictly for enabling calls to be made between 
Java  objects in different virtual machines, and even on different 
physical machines. 

<P>In 1998, came JDK 1.2, which introduced Java<sup><font 
size="-2">TM</font></sup> IDL, a Java API for interoperability and 
integration with CORBA.  Java IDL included both a Java-based ORB, which 
supported IIOP,  and the IDL-to-Java compiler, <TT>idltojava</TT>, for 
generating client-side stubs and server-side code skeletons. This 
release also included a CORBA ORB.

<P>The OMG finalized modifications of its IIOP specification so that it 
would support most of the JDK 1.1 functionality of RMI.  JDK 1.2 
introduced RMI over IIOP, which enabled remote objects written in the 
Java programming language to communicate with objects written in any 
language via IIOP.  


<H2>Comparing the CORBA Programming Models</H2>

<P>The "magic" that gives us the cross-language, cross-vendor 
interoperability is the Internet InterORB Protocol, or IIOP.  IIOP can 
be a transport protocol for distributed applications written in either 
IDL or Java RMI.  IIOP allows distributed objects to conform to OMG's 
CORBA specification.

<P>When using the IDL programming model, the interface is everything!  
It defines the points of entry that can be called from a remote 
process, such as the types of arguments the called procedure will 
accept, or the value/output parameter of information returned.  Using 
IDL, the programmer can make the entry points and datatypes that pass 
between communicating processes act like a standard language.

<P>CORBA is a language-neutral system in which the argument values or 
return values are limited to what can be represented in the involved 
implementaton languages.  In CORBA, object orienation is limited only 
to objects that can be passed by reference (the object code itself 
cannot be passed from machine-to-machine) or are predefined in the 
overall framework.  Passed and returned types must be those declared in 
the interface.

<P>With RMI, the IDL and the implementation language are the same 
thing, so you don't have to worry about mapping from one to the other.  
Language-level objects (the code itself) can be passed from one process 
to the next.  Values can be returned by their actual type, not the 
declared type.  Or, you can compile the interfaces to generate 
IIOP stubs and skeletons to talk to objects written on other 
machines in other CORBA-compliant languages.

<A NAME="rmi"></A>
<H3>The RMI Programming Model</H3> 

<P><B>What is the RMI Programming Model</B></P>


<P>The RMI Programming model enables the programming of CORBA servers and applications 
via the <TT>rmi</TT> API.  You can choose to work completely within the Java programming 
language, using the Java Remote Method Protocol (JRMP) or work with other CORBA-compliant 
programming languages using the Internet InterORB Protocol (IIOP).  This topic discusses using 
IIOP as the transport.  For more information on using the JRMP transport, link to the RMI page 
at <A 
HREF="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/guide/rmi/">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/guide/rmi/
</A>.  

<P>The RMI API utilizes the Java CORBA ORB and 
IIOP, so you can write all of your code in Java, and use the 
<TT>rmic</TT> compiler to generate the code necessary for connecting 
your applications via the Internet InterORB Protocol (IIOP) to others 
written in any CORBA-compliant language.
 
<P>The RMI
 programming model is part of the Java<SUP><FONT 
SIZE="-2">TM</FONT></SUP> 2
Platform, Standard Edition, v1.3.  This enables the ability to
write CORBA applications for the Java platform without learning CORBA
Interface Definition Language (IDL).  To work with CORBA applications 
in
other languages, IDL can be generated from Java programming language
interfaces using the <TT>rmic</TT> compiler with the <TT>-idl</TT> 
option. To generate IIOP stubs and tie classes, use the <TT>rmic</TT> 
compiler with the <TT>-iiop</TT> option.  
J2SE includes the full functionality of a CORBA Object Request
Broker (ORB).  For older versions of the JDK, the <A
HREF="../../../../../products/rmi-iiop/index.html">RMI over IIOP
compiler</A> is available as a separate download.  For more information 
on using <TT>rmic</TT>, link to <A 
HREF="../../tooldocs/solaris/rmic.html">rmic - The Java RMI Stub 
Compiler</A>.

<P><B>When should I use the RMI programming model?</B></P>

<P>The RMI programming model combines the best features of Java Remote 
Method Invocation (RMI) with the best features of CORBA.   The RMI 
programming model speeds distributed application development by 
allowing developers to work completely in the Java programming 
language.  When using the RMI programming model to
produce Java technology-based distributed applications, there is no
separate Interface Definition Language (IDL) or mapping to learn.  The 
RMI programming model provides flexibility by allowing developers to 
pass any
serializable Java object (Objects By Value) between application 
components. Like CORBA, the RMI programming model is based on open 
standards defined with the participation of hundreds of vendors and 
users in the Object Management Group.  Like CORBA, the RMI programming 
model uses Internet Inter-ORB Protocol (IIOP)
as its communication protocol.  IIOP eases legacy application and 
platform
integration by allowing application components written in C++, 
Smalltalk,
and other CORBA supported languages to communicate with components 
running
on the Java platform.

<P>With the RMI programming model, developers can write remote 
interfaces in the Java programming language and implement them simply 
using Java technology and
the Java RMI APIs.  These interfaces can be implemented in any other
language that is supported by an OMG mapping and a vendor supplied ORB 
for
that language.  Similarly, clients can be written in other languages 
using
IDL derived from the remote Java technology-based interfaces.  Using
the RMI programming model, objects can be passed both by reference and 
by value over IIOP.

model</B></P>

<A NAME="idl"></A>
<H3>The IDL Programming Model</H3> 

<P><B>What is the IDL Programming Model</B></P>

<P>The IDL programming model, known as Java<SUP><FONT 
SIZE="-2">TM</FONT></SUP> IDL, consists of both the Java CORBA ORB and 
the <TT>idlj</TT> compiler that maps the OMG IDL to Java bindings that use the 
Java CORBA ORB.

<P> Java<SUP><FONT SIZE="-2">TM</FONT></SUP> IDL is part of the Java 2 
Platform, Standard Edition, v1.3.  To develop applications with Java 
IDL, use <A HREF="../rmi-iiop/toJavaPortableUG.html">Java<SUP><FONT
SIZE="-2">TM</FONT></SUP> IDL Compiler</A>, <TT>idlj</TT>,  which is included with the 
J2SE v1.3 download.  </P>





<P><B>When should I use the IDL programming model?</B></P>

<P>The OMG IDL (Interface Definition Language) is a purely declarative
language designed for specifying programming-language-independent
operational interfaces for distributed applications.  OMG specifies a
mapping from IDL to several different programming languages, including 
C, 
C++, Lisp, Python, Smalltalk, COBOL, Ada, and Java.  When mapped, each statement in 
OMG
IDL is translated to a corresponding statement in the programming 
language
of choice. Java IDL is an implementation of the CORBA specification. 
For example, you could use the Java IDL Compiler, <TT>idlj</TT>, to map 
an IDL
interface to Java and implement the client class in Java.  If you map 
the
same IDL to C++, using another vendor's IDL-to-C++ compiler and C++ ORB,  and implement the 
server in that language, the Java 
client
and C++ server interoperate through the ORB as though they were written 
in
the same language.  </P>

<P><STRONG>NOTE: Although it is true in theory that ORBs written in 
different languages should be able to talk to each other, we haven't tested the 
interoperability of the Java ORB with other vendor's ORBs.</STRONG>

 <P> 
 
 <H3>Comparison of IDL and RMI programming models</H3>
 
 
 <P>There are several scenarios that will define how you will want to 
create distributed CORBA applications.  Here are some of them:
 
 <P>
 <UL>
 <LI>If you have been developing CORBA applications using <A 
HREF="../idl/index.html">IDL</A> for some 
time, you will probably want to stay in this environment.  Create the 
interfaces using IDL, and define the client and server applications 
using the Java programming language to take advantage of its "Write 
Once, Run Anywhere<SUP><FONT SIZE="-2">TM</FONT></SUP>" portability, 
its  highly productive implementation environment, and its very robust 
platform.  
 <P>
 <LI>If all of your applications are written in the Java programming 
language, you will probably want to use <A HREF="../rmi/">Java RMI</A> to enable 
communication between Java objects on different virtual machines and 
different physical machines.  Using Java RMI without its IIOP option 
leverages its strengths of code portability, security, and garbage 
collection.
 <P>
 <LI>If you writing most of your new applications using the Java 
programming language, but need to maintain legacy applications written 
in other programming languages as well, you will probably want to use 
Java RMI with its <A HREF="../rmi-iiop/">IIOP</A> compiler option.
