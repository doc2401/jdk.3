<HR>

<P>This document will show you how to <A HREF="#1">compile</A> and <A HREF="#2">run</A>
a version of the <A HREF="rmisocketfactory.doc.html#4">"Hello World"</A>
example that was modified to install and use a custom RMI socket factory.
<H2>

<HR><A NAME="1"></A>Compiling the Example</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE><p>The first step is to create a directory to hold the source
files, and to download the source files.
If you haven't already completed this step, then please do so now.

<P>For all of the source code used in this tutorial, you may choose from the following formats:
<UL>
    <LI><A HREF="archives/sockets.zip">sockets.zip</A>
    <LI><A HREF="archives/sockets.tar">sockets.tar</A>
    <LI><A HREF="archives/sockets.tar.Z">sockets.tar.Z</A>
</UL>

<p>The
directory that you create and download the source files into will be referred
to as the SOURCE_DIRECTORY. So, if on your machine, you downloaded the
source files into a directory named "test", then when following these instructions,
you should substitute the word "test" wherever you see a reference to the
"SOURCE_DIRECTORY".
<OL>
<LI>
Create your SOURCE_DIRECTORY</LI>

<LI>
Download the source code into your SOURCE_DIRECTORY</LI>

<LI>
Change your directory to the SOURCE_DIRECTORY</LI>

<LI>
Extract the tarfile you downloaded</LI>

<LI>
Compile all the source files as follows:</LI>


<P><code>javac -d . *.java</code>

<P>Because the files from this example all have the package name <code>examples.rmisocfac</code>,
the results of the above command are:
<UL>
<LI>
A directory named <code>examples</code>, created in the SOURCE_DIRECTORY</LI>

<LI>
A directory named <code>rmisocfac</code>, created in the directory <code>examples</code></LI>

<LI>
All the compiled .class files, placed in the directory <code>rmisocfac</code></LI>
</UL>
</OL>

<LI>
After compiling the source files, use the RMI compiler, <code>rmic</code>,
to produce stub and skeleton code for the remote object implementation
server, <code>HelloImpl</code>.</LI>


<P><code>rmic</code> must be invoked with the <I>fully-qualified package name</I>
of the implementation class so in this example, the fully-qualified package
name is <code>examples.rmisocfac.HelloImpl</code>. If you've followed the steps
up until now, you should be sitting in your SOURCE_DIRECTORY, so to invoke
<code>rmic</code>, type:

<P><code>rmic -d . examples.rmisocfac.HelloImpl</code>

<P>When this command completes, the stub and skeleton should be located
in the directory with the rest of the .class files.

<P>On Microsoft Windows platforms that directory would be,  <code>C:\SOURCE_DIRECTORY\examples\rmisocfac</code>

<P>In the Solaris<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>TM</FONT></SUP> operating environment, that directory would be, <code>~/SOURCE_DIRECTORY/examples/rmisocfac</code>

<P>After invoking <code>rmic</code>, the .class files for the stub and skeleton,
<code>HelloImpl_Stub.class</code> and <code>HelloImpl_Skel.class</code> will be
located in <code>~/SOURCE_DIRECTORY/examples/rmisocfac</code>.

<HR>Running the Example</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>In this tutorial, the example will be run in three separate
windows, or shells; one each for the <code>rmiregistry</code>, the client,
and the server.
<OL>
<LI>
In each window, change to the SOURCE_DIRECTORY (assuming the package directory,
<code>examples/rmisocfac</code> is a subdirectory of the SOURCE_DIRECTORY).</LI>

<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
Next, you need to make sure that the Java<SUP><FONT
SIZE=-2>TM</FONT></SUP> 2  platform runtime knows where to find the
executable files. To accomplish this, you'll need to set your
<code>CLASSPATH</code> to include the SOURCE_DIRECTORY in all three
windows.</LI>

<BR>&nbsp;</OL>
Start the registry, then the server and then the client.
<OL>
<LI>
To start the <code>rmiregistry</code>, choose one of the three windows as the
registry window, and type:</LI>


<P><code>rmiregistry </code>

<P><A NAME="registryNote"></A><B>Note: </B><I>Before you start the
</I><code>rmiregistry</code><I>, you must make sure that the shell or
window in which you will run the registry either has no CLASSPATH set
or has a CLASSPATH that does not include the path to any classes that
you want downloaded to your client, including the stubs for your remote
object implementation classes.</I>

<P><I>If you start the </I><code>rmiregistry</code><I>, and it
<b>can</b> find your stub classes in its CLASSPATH, it will ignore the
server's </I><code>java.rmi.server.codebase</code><I> property, and as
a result, your client(s) will not be able to download the stub code for
your remote object. For an explanation of how code downloading works in 
RMI, please take a look at the tutorial on <a href="codebase.html">Dynamic code downloading using RMI</a>.</I>
<p>
<LI>
To start the server, choose a window to be the server window. In that window,
type:</LI>


<P><code>java -Djava.security.policy=/SOURCE_DIRECTORY/policy -Djava.rmi.server.codebase=file:/SOURCE_DIRECTORY/
examples.rmisocfac.HelloImpl</code>

<P>You will know that the server started successfully when you see the
message, "HelloServer Bound in registry." If you encounter errors
starting the server, the likely problems will either be the CLASSPATH
of the rmiregistry or that the <code>java.rmi.server.codebase</code>
property was improperly set.

 
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
To start the client, in the third window, type:</LI>


<P><code>java -Djava.security.policy=/SOURCE_DIRECTORY/policy examples.rmisocfac.HelloClient</code>

<P>You will know that the <code>HelloClient</code> program completed
successfully when the message "Hello World!" is printed to in that
window.&nbsp;
