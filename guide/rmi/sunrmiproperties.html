WARNING: The properties described here are not supported, can change at
any time, and only exist in certain implementations of RMI from Sun
Microsystems<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup>. These properties are
not part of the RMI public API and are documented in this FAQ as a
debugging aid only.
</b>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<b>Please Note</b>: Unless otherwise stated, any output from these
properties is sent to <code>System.err</code>. Each of the properties
that have names ending in "<code>.logLevel</code>" have possible values
of "<code>SILENT</code>", "<code>BRIEF</code>", and
"<code>VERBOSE</code>". These values are case insensitive and may be
abbreviated as a string containing the first <i>n</i> letters, where
<i>n</i> is greater than or equal to 1.  If not specified, these
properties have a default value of "<code>SILENT</code>".  Logging
messages are sent to <code>System.err</code>. For instance, if a
property is said to send output to the "transport" log, this means that
logging messages are sent to a <code>LogStream</code> returned by
<code>java.rmi.server.LogStream.log("transport")</code>, which sends
messages to <code>System.err</code>, unless you've set it to something
else.

<h2>Properties that can be set on <code>rmid</code></h2>

<blockquote>
<dl>
<b><code>sun.rmi.activation.execTimeout</b></code> (1.2 and later)</dt> 
	<dd> The value of this property represents the time (in
	milliseconds) that the activation system will wait for a
	spawned activation group to start up.  Setting this property
	gives you the ability to shorten or lengthen the maximum time
	that <code>rmid</code> will wait for an activation group to
	start up. The default value is 30000 milliseconds (30
	seconds).</dd>
<p>
<dt><b><code>sun.rmi.activation.snapshotInterval</b></code> (1.2 and
later)</dt>
	<dd> This property controls the number of updates for which the
	activation system will wait before it serializes a snapshot of
	its state to the <code>rmid</code> log file on disk. An
	"update" refers to a persistent change in the state of the
	activation system (for example, the registration of an
	<code>Activatable</code> object) since the last snapshot was
	taken. Changing the value of this property can be used to make
	<code>rmid</code> re-start more quickly (by taking snapshots of
	the log more often) or to make <code>rmid</code> more efficient
	(by taking snapshots of the log less often). The value of this
	property is a positive integer value.  The default value is
	200.</dd>
<p>
<dt><b><code>sun.rmi.log.debug</b></code> (1.2 and later)</dt> 
	<dd> If this value is <code>true</code>, details of
	<code>rmid</code>'s logging activity are sent to
	<code>System.err</code>.</dd>
<p>
<dt><b><code>sun.rmi.rmid.maxstartgroup</b></code> (1.2 and later)</dt> 
	<dd> The value of this property represents the maximum number
	of activation group VMs that <code>rmid</code> will allow to be in the
	"spawning but not yet active" state simultaneously.  If more
	VMs need to be started, they will queue up until one of the
	current spawn attempts either succeeds or times out.  Note that
	this property does not limit the maximum number of active VMs;
	it is intended to smooth out sudden spikes of activity to avoid
	reaching operating system limits. While setting the value of
	this property to a lower number may result in a longer start-up
	time for <code>rmid</code>, and setting the value to a higher
	number could shorten the start-up time, setting this value too
	high can crash <code>rmid</code>, because your system may run
	out of resources. The default value is 3. </dd>

<p>
<dt><b><code>sun.rmi.server.activation.debugExec</b></code> (1.2 and later)</dt>
	<dd> If this value is <code>true</code>, the activation system
	will print out debugging information to the command line that
	is used for spawning activation groups.  By default, the value
	is <code>false</code>, so debugging information is not
	printed.</dd>

<h2>Properties that are useful to set on JVMs<sup><font
size=-2>*</font></sup> that export remote objects </h2>


<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt><b><code>sun.rmi.dgc.checkInterval</b></code> (1.1 and later)</dt> 
	<dd> The value of this property represents (in milliseconds)
	how often the RMI runtime checks for expired DGC leases.  The
	default value is 300000 milliseconds (5 minutes).</dd>
<p>
<dt><b><code>sun.rmi.dgc.logLevel</b></code> (1.1 and later)</dt> 
	<dd> This property controls the logging of incoming and
	outgoing calls related to DGC lease granting, renewing, and
	expiration.  It sends output to the "dgc" log.</dd>

<p>
<dt><b><code>sun.rmi.dgc.server.gcInterval</b></code> (1.2 and later)</dt> 
	<dd> When it is necessary to ensure that unreachable remote
	objects are unexported and garbage collected in a timely
	fashion, the value of this property represents the maximum
	interval (in milliseconds) that the RMI runtime will allow
	between garbage collections of the local heap. The default
	value is 60000 milliseconds (60 seconds).</dd>
<p>
<dt><b><code>sun.rmi.loader.logLevel</b></code> (1.2 and later)</dt> 
	<dd> This property controls the logging of each class name and
	codebase, whenever the RMI runtime attempts to load a class as
	a result of unmarshalling either an argument or return value.
	Please note that the codebase that is printed is the
	<i>annotated</i> codebase, but may not necessarily be the
	actual codebase from which the class gets loaded; the RMI class
	loader defers the class loading to the current thread's context
	class loader, which may load the class from the CLASSPATH,
	rather than the annotated codebase. This property sends output
	to the "loader" log.</dd>
<p>
<a name="et"></a>
<dt><b><code>sun.rmi.server.exceptionTrace</b></code> (1.2 and later)</dt> 
	<dd> This property controls the output of server-side stack
	traces from exceptions and errors that are thrown by
	dispatched, incoming remote calls.  If this value is
	<code>true</code>, exception stack traces will be printed. By
	default (<code>false</code>), exception and error stack traces
	are not printed.</dd>
<p>
<dt><b><code>sun.rmi.transport.logLevel</b></code> (1.1 and later)</dt> 
	<dd> This property controls detailed logging throughout the
	transport layer.  It sends output to the "transport" log.</dd>
<p>
<dt><b><code>sun.rmi.transport.tcp.localHostNameTimeOut</b></code> (1.1.7 and later)</dt> 
	<dd> The value of this property represents the time (in
	milliseconds) that the RMI runtime will wait to obtain a fully
	qualified domain name for the local host. The default value is
	10000 milliseconds (10 seconds).</dd>
<p>
<dt><b><code>sun.rmi.transport.tcp.logLevel</b></code> (1.1 and later)</dt> 
	<dd> This property provides detailed logging for the
	TCP-specific transport sub-layer.  It sends output to the "tcp"
	log.</dd>
<p>
<a name=readTimeout></a>
<dt><b><code>sun.rmi.transport.tcp.readTimeout</b></code> (1.2.2 and later)</dt>
	<dd> The value of this property represents the time (in
	milliseconds) used as an idle timeout for incoming RMI-TCP
	connections. The value is passed to
	<code>java.net.Socket.setSoTimeout</code>. This property is
	used only for cases where a client has not dropped an unused
	connection as it should (see <a href="#connectionTimeout"><i>
	<code>sun.rmi.transport.connectionTimeout</b></a></i></code>). The
	default value is 2*3600*1000 milliseconds (2 hours).</dd>

<h2>Properties that are useful to set on JVMs that make remote method
calls</h2>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt><b><code>sun.rmi.dgc.cleanInterval</b></code> (1.1 and later)</dt> 
	<dd> The value of this property represents the maximum length
	of time (in milliseconds) that the RMI runtime will wait before
	retrying a failed DGC "clean" call. The default value is 180000
	milliseconds (3 minutes).</dd>
<p>
<dt><b><code>sun.rmi.dgc.client.gcInterval</b></code> (1.2 and later) 
	<dd>When it is necessary to ensure that DGC clean calls for
	unreachable remote references are delivered in a timely
	fashion, the value of this property represents the maximum
	interval (in milliseconds) that the RMI runtime will allow
	between garbage collections of the local heap.  The default
	value is 60000 milliseconds (60 seconds).</dd>
<p>
<dt><b><code>sun.rmi.loader.logLevel</b></code> (1.2 and later)</dt> 
	<dd> This property controls the logging of each class name and
	codebase, whenever the RMI runtime attempts to load a class as
	a result of unmarshalling either an argument or return value.
	Please note that the codebase that is printed is the
	<i>annotated</i> codebase, but may not necessarily be the
	actual codebase from which the class gets loaded; the RMI class
	loader defers the class loading to the current thread's context
	class loader, which may load the class from the CLASSPATH,
	rather than the annotated codebase. This property sends output
	to the "loader" log.</dd>
<p>
<dt><b><code>sun.rmi.server.logLevel</b></code> (1.1 and later)</dt> 
	<dd> This property controls the logging of information related
	to outgoing calls, including some connection-reuse
	information.  It sends output to the "transport" log.</dd>
<p>
<a name="connectionTimeout"></a>
<dt><b><code>sun.rmi.transport.connectionTimeout</b></code> (1.1.6 and later)</dt>
	<dd> The value of this property represents the period (in
	milliseconds) for which RMI socket connections may reside in an
	"unused" state, before the RMI runtime will allow those
	connections to be freed (closed). The default value is 15000
	milliseconds (15 seconds). See also <a href="#readTimeout">
	<i><code>sun.rmi.transport.tcp.readTimeout</b></a></code></i>.</dd>
<p>
<dt><b><code>sun.rmi.transport.logLevel</b></code> (1.1 and later)</dt> 
	<dd> This property controls detailed logging throughout the
	transport layer.  It sends output to the "transport" log.</dd>
<p>
<dt><b><code>sun.rmi.transport.proxy.connectTimeout</b></code> (1.1 and later)</dt> 
	<dd> The value of this property represents the maximum length
	of time (in milliseconds) that the RMI runtime will wait for a
	connection attempt (<code>createSocket</code>) to complete,
	before attempting to contact the server using HTTP. This
	property is only used when the <code>http.proxyHost</code>
	property is set and the value of
	<code>java.rmi.server.disableHttp</code> is <code>false</code>.
	The default value is 15000 milliseconds (15 seconds).</dd>
<p>
<dt><b><code>sun.rmi.transport.proxy.logLevel</b></code> (1.1 and later)</dt>
	<dd> This property controls the logging of events
	(<code>createSocket</code> and <code>createServerSocket</code>)
	when the default <code>RMISocketFactory</code> class is used.
	This type of logging is likely to be useful for applications
	that use RMI over HTTP. Events in custom socket factories are
	not logged by this property.  It sends some messages to the
	"proxy" log, and others to the "transport" log.</dd>
<p>
<dt><b><code>sun.rmi.transport.tcp.logLevel</b></code> (1.1 and later)</dt> 
	<dd> This property provides detailed logging for the
	TCP-specific transport sub-layer.  It sends output to the "tcp"
	log.</dd>
