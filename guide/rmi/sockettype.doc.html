      Creating a Custom Socket Type
      </center></font></h1>
<hr>

<p>Often it is necessary to process data either before it is sent to, 
or after it has been received from, a socket.  Instead of using 
<code>java.net.Socket</code> sockets with pre- and post-processing, 
another type of socket can be used. 

<p> This page shows you the steps to follow to create a custom socket 
type. It also contains an example implementation of a custom socket 
named <code>CompressionSocket</code>, which compresses data sent 
over the connection it uses. 

<p>The <code>CompressionSocket</code> and its supporting classes are
also used in our tutorial on <a href="rmisocketfactory.doc.html"><i>how
to create a custom RMI socket factory</i></a>.  As a result, the source
files for this example are all in the <code>examples.rmisocfac</code>
package.

<a NAME="1">
<p>In this tutorial, creating the <code>CompressionSocket</code> class 
and related classes is broken down into the following four steps, which
can be adapted to create other custom socket type:

	  and <code>close</code> methods.</a>

      <h2>Step 1: <br> Extend <code>FilterOutputStream</code> to Create an 
	Output Stream for the Socket.</h2>
</a>
<blockquote>
      <p> Because we are writing a socket that does data compression, we
	will write a class named <code>CompressionOutputStream</code> that
	extends <code>FilterOutputStream</code>.  However, extending 
	<code>FilterOutputStream</code> will not be appropriate in every case.
	In general, you should extend the type of output stream best-suited
	for the type of socket you are implementing.  In this example,
	<code>FilterOutputStream</code> is most appropriate.


      <p> For our example, we will use a <em>very simple</em> algorithm
	that provides 6-bit character encoding for up to 62 common
	characters and 18-bit encoding for the other characters
	(remember that in the Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup>
	programming language characters are usually 16 bits).  There is
	a lookup table to map the 62 common characters to 6-bit numbers
	in the range 0 to 61. Depending on the result of the lookup,
	each encoded character is marked with a constant to indicate
	whether it has 6-bit or 18-bit encoding.  Finally, the encoded
	characters are written to the stream.  This algorithm assumes
	that all characters encountered are ASCII, and that the
	high-order byte of each character is unused.


      <p><b>Please note:</b> <i>This algorithm is <b>not</b> recommended
	for use in any application requiring data compression.  It is
	included only for this example and <b>is not intended for
	practical use</b>.</i>
	
	<p> Before writing any sample code that demonstrates how to
	create custom sockets, it is necessary to write an interface
	containing the information to be shared between the input and
	output stream classes so the common character lookup table,
	<code>codeTable</code> and 3 constants are included as
	members.  It is useful to note that while an interface is
	included in this example, an interface is not always required.

        <p><dl><pre>
interface CompressionConstants {
 
    /** Constants for 6-bit code values. */

    /** No operation: used to pad words on flush. */
    static final int NOP     = 0;  

    /** Introduces raw byte format. */
    static final int RAW     = 1;  

    /** Format indicator for characters found in lookup table. */
    static final int BASE    = 2;  

    /** A character's code is it's index in the lookup table. */
    static final String codeTable =
        "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" +
        "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ ,.!?\"'()";
}
	</pre></dl>
      
	<p> The source code for the <code>CompressionConstants</code>
        interface can be found <a
        href="code/CompressionConstants.java"><i>here</i></a>.
	
	<p>Now that the interface for sharing information between the
	input and output streams has been defined, we will complete
	Step 1, which was to write a class that extends
	<code>java.io.FilterOutputStream</code> in order to create an
	output stream for the socket, overriding
	<code>FilterOutputStream</code> methods as necessary.

      <p>Below is the source code for the class 
	<code>CompressionOutputStream.java</code>.  An explanation of the
	  compression algorithm can be found in the comments of the
	  source code.  An explanation of the implementation follows the
	  code.

      <p>  First, <code>CompressionOutputStream</code> subclasses
	<code>FilterOutputStream</code>. Then it implements the interface
	<code>CompressionConstants</code> so that it can have access 
	to the lookup table and constants.  

	<p> In order to compress the data, the <code>FilterOutputStream
	  write</code> methods are overridden by
	<code>CompressionOutputStream</code>.  The method 
 <p><code>public void write(int b)</code>
	<p>writes one character per invocation, and is
responsible for marking each character with its encoding format using
a compression constant (either <code>RAW</code> or <code>BASE</code>)
and dividing the character into two 4-bit parts when necessary.  

<p>The method
<p> <code>public void write(byte b[], int off, int len)</code>

  <p> allows one to write <code>len</code> characters.  It calls the
<code>write</code> method that writes one character per invocation
<code>len</code> times.  

<p>The method <code>writeCode</code> is responsible for packing five
6-bit codes into one word (which could encode up to five characters) 
and writing that word to the output stream.

    <p> When writing your own input stream, it is necessary to provide
	methods for getting data from the stream.  Therefore, in addition to a
	constructor, two <code>FilterOutputStream read</code> methods were
	overridden.  The method  

	<p><code>public int read()</code> 

	<p> reads one character per invocation and is responsible for
	decoding the 6-bit codes unpacked by the method <code>writeCode</code>. 

	<p> The method

	<p><code> public int read(byte b[], int off, int len)</code>

	<p> causes up to <code>len</code> bytes to be read and placed into the
	array <code>b</code>.  It accomplishes this through up to
	<code>len</code> calls to the <code>read</code> method that
	reads one character per invocation.  In addition to returning
	once <code>len</code> bytes have been read or once the end of
	the file has been reached, this method also returns as soon as
	no more bytes can be read without blocking.

	<p>The method <code>readCode</code>, which corresponds to the 
	<code>writeCode</code> method in <code>CompressionOutputStream</code>, 
	is responsible for reading data	from the stream and unpacking each 
	group of four bytes into five 6-bit codes (which are then decoded by 
	<code>read</code>).

      create a socket of the desired type.</h2>
</a>
<blockquote>

	<p>  The last step in writing a custom socket is creating a 
	subclass of <code>ServerSocket</code> that supports your protocol.  In 
	this case, our subclass will be <code>CompressionServerSocket</code>.

	<p> Below is the source code for the 
	<code>CompressionServerSocket</code> class, followed by a discussion of 
	the class. 

<p><dl><pre>

	<p> As was the case with <code>CompressionSocket</code>, in order to 
	provide server sockets that communicate using our compression protocol, 
	we need to implement the constructor, and then make sure that all 
	methods	that use sockets of type <code>java.net.Socket</code> are 
	overridden to use sockets of type <code>CompressionSocket</code>.

	<p> Implementing the constructor is as simple as calling the
	constructor of the super class.

	<p> The only <code>ServerSocket</code> class method that needs to be
	overridden is the method <code>accept</code>.  It is overridden to
	instantiate a socket of type <code>CompressionSocket</code> instead of
	type <code>Socket</code>. 

	<p> The above simplifications are possible because the compression
	socket type described in this tutorial is a protocol layer on top of
	TCP, the default protocol used by <code>java.net.Socket</code> and
	<code>java.net.ServerSocket</code>.  Accordingly, it shares the
	same meaning for the rest of the methods, as well as a similar
	connection-establishment interface.
