<blockquote>
<a name="62586"><!-- --></a>
A <kbd>ColorModel</kbd> is used to interpret pixel data in an image. This includes mapping components in the bands of an image to components of a particular color space. It might also involve extracting pixel components from packed pixel data, retrieving 

multiple components from a single band using masks, and converting pixel data through a lookup table. <p>
<a name="62297"><!-- --></a>
To determine the color value of a particular pixel in an image, you need to know how color information is encoded in each pixel. The <kbd>ColorModel</kbd> associated with an image encapsulates the data and methods necessary for translating a pixel value t

o and from its constituent color components. <p>
<a name="62298"><!-- --></a>
The Java 2D<sup>TM</sup> API provides two color models in addition to the <kbd>DirectColorModel</kbd> and <kbd>IndexColorModel</kbd> defined in the JDK 1.1 software release: <p>

<ul><li>
<a name="62299"><!-- --></a>
<kbd>ComponentColorModel</kbd> can handle an arbitrary <kbd>ColorSpace</kbd> and an array of color components to match the <kbd>ColorSpace</kbd>. This model can be used to represent most color models on most types of <kbd>GraphicsDevices</kbd>. 
</li>
<li>
<a name="62300"><!-- --></a>
<kbd>PackedColorModel</kbd> is a base class for models that represent pixel values that have their color components embedded directly in the bits of an integer pixel. A <kbd>PackedColorModel</kbd> stores the packing information that describes how color an

d alpha components are extracted from the channel.The <kbd>DirectColorModel</kbd> in the JDK 1.1 software release is a <kbd>PackedColorModel</kbd>.

<h4><i>6.2.0.1	 ColorSpace
</i></h4>

<blockquote>
<a name="62303"><!-- --></a>
A <kbd>ColorSpace</kbd> object represents a system for measuring colors, typically using three separate numeric values. For example, RGB and CMYK are color spaces. A <kbd>ColorSpace</kbd> object serves as a colorspace tag that identifies the specific colo

r space of a <kbd>Color</kbd> object or, through a <kbd>ColorModel</kbd> object, of an <kbd>Image</kbd>, <kbd>BufferedImage</kbd>, or <kbd>GraphicsConfiguration</kbd>. <kbd>ColorSpace</kbd> provides methods that transform <kbd>Colors</kbd> in a specific c

olor space to and from <kbd>sRGB</kbd> and to and from a well-defined <kbd>CIEXYZ</kbd> color space.<p>
<a name="62304"><!-- --></a>
All <kbd>ColorSpace</kbd> objects must be able to map a color from the represented color space into <kbd>sRGB</kbd> and transform an <kbd>sRGB</kbd> color into the represented color space. Since every <kbd>Color</kbd> contains a <kbd>ColorSpace</kbd> obje

ct, set explicitly or by default, every <kbd>Color</kbd> can also be converted to <kbd>sRGB</kbd>. Every <kbd>GraphicsConfiguration</kbd> is associated with a <kbd>ColorSpace</kbd> object that in turn has an associated <kbd>ColorSpace</kbd>. A color speci

fied in any color space can be displayed by any device by mapping it through <kbd>sRGB</kbd> as an intermediate color space.<p>
<a name="62305"><!-- --></a>
The methods used for this process are <kbd>toRGB</kbd> and <kbd>fromRGB:</kbd><p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul><li>
<a name="62306"><!-- --></a>
<kbd>toRGB</kbd> transforms a <kbd>Color</kbd> in the represented color space to a <kbd>Color</kbd> in <kbd>sRGB</kbd>. 
</li>
<li>
<a name="62307"><!-- --></a>
<kbd>fromRGB</kbd> takes a <kbd>Color</kbd> in <kbd>sRGB</kbd> and transforms it into the represented color space.
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<a name="62308"><!-- --></a>
Though mapping through <kbd>sRGB</kbd> always works, it's not always the best solution. For one thing, <kbd>sRGB</kbd> cannot represent every color in the full gamut of <kbd>CIEXYZ</kbd> colors. If a color is specified in some space that has a different g

amut (spectrum of representable colors) than <kbd>sRGB</kbd>, then using <kbd>sRGB</kbd> as an intermediate space results in a loss of information. To address this problem, the <kbd>ColorSpace</kbd> class can map colors to and from another color space, th

e &#34;conversion space&#34; <kbd>CIEXYZ</kbd>.<p>
<a name="62309"><!-- --></a>
The methods <kbd>toCIEXYZ</kbd> and <kbd>fromCIEXYZ</kbd> map color values from the represented color space to the conversion space. These methods support conversions between any two color spaces at a reasonably high degree of accuracy, one 
<kbd>Color</kbd> at a time. However, it is expected that Java 2D API implementations will support high-performance conversion based on underlying platform color-management systems, operating on entire images. (See <kbd>ColorConvertOp</kbd> in 
<a href="j2d-image.fm.html#65661">&#34;Imaging&#34;</a>.)<p>

As this figure illustrates, the translation of the CMYK color to an RGB color is not exact because of a gamut mismatch. <a href="#62325"><sup>1</sup></a><p>

<h4><i>6.2.0.2	 ICC_Profile and ICC_ColorSpace
</i></h4>

<blockquote>
<a name="62423"><!-- --></a>
<kbd>ColorSpace</kbd> is actually an abstract class. The Java 2D API provides one implementation, <kbd>ICC_ColorSpace</kbd>, which is based on ICC Profile data as represented by the <kbd>ICC_Profile</kbd> class. You can define your own subclasses to repre

sent arbitrary color spaces, as long as the methods discussed above are implemented. However, most developers can simply use the default <kbd>sRGB</kbd> <kbd>ColorSpace</kbd> or color spaces that are represented by commonly available ICC Profiles, such as

 profiles for monitors and printers, or profiles embedded in image data.<p>
<a name="62427"><!-- --></a>
<a href="j2d-color.fm2.html#62302">&#34;ColorSpace&#34;</a> 
describes how <kbd>ColorSpace</kbd> objects represent a color space 
and how colors in the represented space can be mapped to and from a 
conversion space. Color management systems 
are often used to handle the mapping between color spaces. 
A typical color management system (CMS) manages ICC profiles, which 
are similar to <kbd>ColorSpace</kbd> objects; ICC profiles describe 
an input space and a connection space, and define how to map
 between them. Color management systems are very good at figuring out 
how to map a color tagged with one profile into the color space of 
another profile.<p>
<a name="62428"><!-- --></a>
The Java 2D API defines a class called <kbd>ICC_Profile</kbd> that 
holds data for an arbitrary ICC Profile. <kbd>ICC_ColorSpace</kbd> is 
an implementation of the abstract <kbd>ColorSpace</kbd> class. 
<kbd>ICC_ColorSpace</kbd> objects can be constructed from 
<kbd>ICC_Profiles</kbd>. (There are some limitations&#45;&#45;not 
all ICC Profiles are appropriate for defining an 
<kbd>ICC_ColorSpace</kbd>). <p>
<a name="62429"><!-- --></a>
<kbd>ICC_Profile</kbd> has several subclasses that correspond to specific color space types, such as <kbd>ICC_ProfileRGB</kbd> and <kbd>ICC_ProfileGray</kbd>. Each subclass of <kbd>ICC_Profile</kbd> has a well-defined input space (such as an RGB space) an

d a well-defined connection space (like <kbd>CIEXYZ</kbd>). The Java 2D API can use a platform's CMS to access color profiles for various devices such as scanners, printers, and monitors. It can also use the CMS to find the best mapping between profiles.<

<i>6.2.1	</i> Describing Colors
</h3>

<blockquote>
<a name="62437"><!-- --></a>
The <kbd>Color</kbd> class provides a description of a color in a particular color space. An instance of <kbd>Color</kbd> contains the value of the color components and a <kbd>ColorSpace</kbd> object. Because a <kbd>ColorSpace</kbd> object can be specifie

d in addition to the color components when a new instance of <kbd>Color</kbd> is created, the <kbd>Color</kbd> class can handle colors in any color space.<p>
<a name="62438"><!-- --></a>
The <kbd>Color</kbd> class has a number of methods that support a proposed standard RGB color space called <kbd>sRGB</kbd> (see <kbd>http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Graphics/Color/sRGB.html</kbd>). <kbd>sRGB</kbd> is the default color space for the Java 2D API.

 Several constructors defined by the Color class omit the <kbd>ColorSpace</kbd> parameter. These constructors assume that the color's RGB values are defined in <kbd>sRGB</kbd>, and use a default instance of <kbd>ColorSpace</kbd> to represent that space.<p

>
<a name="62439"><!-- --></a>
The Java 2D API uses <kbd>sRGB</kbd> as a convenience to application programmers, not as a reference color space for color conversion. Many applications are primarily concerned with RGB images and monitors, and defining a standard RGB color space makes wr

iting such applications easier. The <kbd>ColorSpace</kbd> class defines the methods <kbd>toRGB</kbd> and <kbd>fromRGB</kbd> so that developers can easily retrieve colors in this standard space. These methods are not intended to be used for highly accurate

 color correction or conversions. See <a href="j2d-color.fm2.html#62302">&#34;ColorSpace&#34;</a> for more information.<p>
<a name="62443"><!-- --></a>
To create a color in a color space other than <kbd>sRGB</kbd>, you use the <kbd>Color</kbd> constructor that takes a 
<kbd>ColorSpace</kbd> object and an array of floats that represent the color components appropriate to that space. The 
<kbd>ColorSpace</kbd> object identifies the color space.<p>
<a name="61780"><!-- --></a>
To display a rectangle of a certain color, such as the process color cyan, you need a way to describe this color to the system. There are a number of different ways to describe a color; for example, a color could be described as a set of red, green, and b

lue (RGB) components, or a set of cyan, magenta, yellow, and black (CMYK) components. These different techniques for specifying colors are called<em> color spaces</em>. <p>
<a name="61781"><!-- --></a>
As you probably know, colors on a computer screen are generated by blending different amounts of red, green, and blue light. Therefore, using an RGB color space is standard for imaging on computer monitors. Similarly, four-color process printing uses cyan

, magenta, yellow, and black ink to produce color on a printed page; the printed colors are specified as percentages in a CMYK color space. <p>
<a name="61782"><!-- --></a>
Due to the prevalence of computer monitors and color printing, RGB and CMYK color spaces are both commonly used to describe colors. However, both types of color spaces have a fundamental drawback&#45;&#45;they are device-dependent. The cyan ink used by on

e printer might not exactly match the cyan ink used by another. Similarly, a color described as an RGB color might look blue on one monitor and purplish on another. <p>

<i>6.2.2	</i> Mapping Colors through sRGB and CIEXYZ
</h3>

<blockquote>
<a name="62282"><!-- --></a>
The Java 2D API refers to RGB and CMYK as color space types. A particular model of monitor with its particular phosphors defines its own RGB color space. Similarly, a particular model of printer has its own CMYK color space. Different RGB or CMYK color sp

aces can be related to each other through a device-independent color space.<p>
<a name="61784"><!-- --></a>
Standards for the device-independent specification of color have been defined by the International Commission on Illumination (CIE). The most commonly used device-independent color space is the three-component XYZ color space developed by CIE. When you sp

ecify a color using <kbd>CIEXYZ</kbd>, you are insulated from device dependencies.<p>
<a name="61785"><!-- --></a>
Unfortunately, it&#39;s not always practical to describe colors in the <kbd>CIEXYZ</kbd> color space&#45;&#45;there are valid reasons for representing colors in other color spaces. To obtain consistent results when a color is represented using a device-de

pendent color space such as a particular RGB space, it is necessary to show how that RGB&#160;space relates to a device-independent space like <kbd>CIEXYZ</kbd>.<p>
<a name="61786"><!-- --></a>
One way to map between color spaces is to attach information to the spaces that describes how the device-dependent space relates to the device-independent space. This additional information is called a <em>profile</em>. A commonly used type of color profi

le is the ICC Color Profile, as defined by the International Color Consortium. For details, see the ICC Profile Format Specification, version 3.4 available at <kbd>http://www.color.org</kbd>.<p>
<a name="61790"><!-- --></a>
<a href="j2d-color.fm2.html#61912">Figure&#160;6-3</a> illustrates how a solid color and a scanned image are passed to the Java 2D API, and how they are displayed by various output devices. As you can see in <a href="j2d-color.fm2.html#61912">Figure&#160;

6-3</a>, both the input color and the image have profiles attached.<p>

<h4><i>6.2.2.1	 Color Matching 
</i></h4>

<blockquote>
<a name="62270"><!-- --></a>
Once the API has an accurately specified color, it must reproduce that color on an output device, such as a monitor or printer. These devices have imaging characteristics of their own that must be taken into account to make sure that they produce the corr

ect results. Another profile is associated with each output device to describe how the colors need to be transformed to produce accurate results.<p>
<a name="62724"><!-- --></a>
Achieving consistent and accurate color requires that both input colors and output devices be profiled against a standard color space. For example, an input color could be mapped from its original color space into a standard device-independent space, and 

then mapped from that space to the output device&#39;s color space. In many respects, the transformation of colors mimics the transformation of graphical objects in an (<em>x</em>,&#160;<em>y</em>) coordinate space. In both cases, a transformation is used

 to specify coordinates in a &#34;standard&#34; space and then map those coordinates to a device-specific space for output.<p>
