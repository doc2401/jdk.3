<h3>API Enhancements</h3></a>

The following new classes and interfaces have been added to the 
Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> Accessibility API in version 1.3 
of the Java 2 Platform:
<ul><b>
<li><a href="../../api/javax/accessibility/AccessibleIcon.html">javax.accessibility.AccessibleIcon</a>
<li><a href="../../api/javax/accessibility/AccessibleRelation.html">javax.accessibility.AccessibleRelation</a>
<li><a href="../../api/javax/accessibility/AccessibleRelationSet.html">javax.accessibility.AccessibleRelationSet</a>
<li><a href="../../api/javax/accessibility/AccessibleTable.html">javax.accessibility.AccessibleTable</a>
<li><a href="../../api/javax/accessibility/AccessibleTableModelChange.html">javax.accessibility.AccessibleTableModelChange</a>
</b></ul>
In addition, <b><a href="../../api/javax/accessibility/AccessibleContext.html">javax.accessibility.AccessibleContext</a></b> was updated to reflect the new 
classes and interfaces.

<a name=icon>
<h3>Accessible Icon</h3></a>

<a href="../../api/javax/accessibility/AccessibleIcon.html"><b>AccessibleIcon</b></a> provides information about an icon's description and dimension. It 
also allows these properties to be set by the application developer. 
This feature is implemented by Swing icons.
<p>

<a name=relation>
<h3>Accessible Relation and Accessible Relation Set</h3></a>

<a href="../../api/javax/accessibility/AccessibleRelation.html"><b>AccessibleRelation</b></a> and <a href="../../api/javax/accessibility/AccessibleRelationSet.html"><b>AccessibleRelationSet</b></a> provide information about the ways user
interface objects are related to each other. Each relation is captured in an
AccessibleRelation object, and the full set of relations that any given user
interface object is involved in are expressed in that object's
AccessibleRelationSet.
<p>
Unlike most of the rest of the Accessibility
API, there is currently no built-in support for having AccessibleRelations
set automatically by Swing. This means that even if a programmer is doing
nothing out of the ordinary - using
standard components in standard ways - the AccessibleRelation information
will have to be specifically included by the programmer.
<p>
The only exception to this is if the programmer uses the
<a href="../../api/javax/swing/JLabel.html#setLabelFor(java.awt.Component)"><b>JLabel.setLabelFor()</b></a> method to link a label to the thing it 
labels. This will cause an accessible relationship to be created.

<a name=table>
<h3>Accessible Table</h3></a>

<a href="../../api/javax/accessibility/AccessibleTable.html"><b>AccessibleTable</b></a> provides information about tables, and is implemented by
Swing's <a href="../../api/javax/swing/JTable.AccessibleJTable.html"><b>JTable.AccessibleJTable</b></a> class. It allows a range of table-specific 
attributes to be identified adn manipulated.  Such properties include 
text selections, the first and last row and column of the table, 
its total number of rows and columns, the text of its captions and 
headers, and other descriptions about its contents and format. As in 
the AccessibleIcon interface, these kinds of properties (descriptions, 
captions, and headers) can be set or modified by users and developers.

<a name=model>
<h3>Accessible Table Model Change</h3></a>

<a href="../../api/javax/accessibility/AccessibleTableModelChange.html"><b>AccessibleTableModelChange</b></a> is a helper class which
encapsulates a change to the model of a table. Such changes can inlcude 
insertions, deletions, and data updates.

<a name=lightweight>
<h3>AWT Accessibililty Support for Lightweight Components</h3></a>

The core accessibility support which was provided in the Java 2
Platform has been moved up the inheritance tree. This means that it is not only
present in Swing components, it is also part of all lightweight AWT
components.
<p>
Prior to version 1.3 of the Java 2 Platform, if a developer wished to create an accessible custom
component, s/he had two options.
<ul>
<li>To extend one of the Swing components.
<li>To extend one of the AWT components--a task that involved more work.
</ul>
<p>
Now that accessibility support has been included in both AWT Component and
AWT Container, the task of implementing the accessibility API on 
non-Swing components is easier.
<p>
It is important to note that this accessibility support has not yet been
incorporated into AWTList, some portions of AWT Text, AWT Menu, and AWT
Combobox/Popup Menu. In addition, further work needs to be done in areas
where the modification of native code is required. For the present, the
necessary API is there, but it returns a <tt>null</tt> value. It is hoped that
support for "heavyweight" components will be integrated into subsequent
versions of the Java 2 Platform.

<a name=applet>
<h3>Accessible Applet</h3></a>

This work is similar to the changes made for the AWT accessibility support
described above.

<a name=robot>
<h3>AWT Robot</h3></a>

The AWT's new <a href=../../api/java/awt/Robot.html>Robot</a> class provides 
a way to insert keystrokes and mouse events at the system
level. This feature enhances accessibility because it allows the physical
on-screen mouse cursor to be moved. This enables screen magnification
software for native environments to recognize and respond to mouse movements
that could not previously be identified by assistive technologies outside of
the virtual machine.
<p>
It is important to note that, although this improves overall accessibility,
it is not a comprehensive solution. For instance, the AWT Robot does not
allow native assistive technologies to track the focus or the caret.
