      <P>Evolution in open distributed systems needs to be managed carefully
        because correct operation depends on a number of dependencies between
        packages. Changes within a distributed system can have a significant
        impact on many groups of individuals, including users, support
        organizations, web administrators, and developers. Packages within a
        distributed system need to operate correctly with only partial knowledge
        about the state of the whole system. The difficulty level increases
        because the packages of the system must be able to evolve at different
        rates. Evolution in such a system is made possible by explicitly
        managing the dependencies between the packages using techniques of
        object oriented design to govern how individual packages evolve. The
        Java language defines packages that are a natural for the consistent
        unit of update, packages that expose only public interfaces and that
        consume only public interfaces of other classes.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

      <P>In any system, support must be provided for the system to evolve over
        time. Most existing systems have conventions and mechanisms that specify
        how change is accommodated. These systems have been based on the model
        where software programs are installed on a computer. Typically,
        developers specify what versions of other packages are required and the
        installation process verifies and configures the system. </P>
      
      <P>In open distributed systems, however, the static assumptions of
        existing systems do not work. Evolution is more difficult because it is
        not possible to control how or when packages change. Correct operation
        depends on a greater number of dependencies between packages. There is a
        real need for an updated set of conventions and mechanisms which specify
        how packages of a system should evolve so that the goal of an open
        reliable scalable distributed system can be achieved. </P>

    Distributed Systems</U></H2>
    
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      
      <P>Problems can occur in open distributed systems when packages evolve
        and are frequently updated. If the specified behavior inherent in the
        use of public interfaces is not maintained, the system can fail in
        unexpected ways. Open systems are comprised of many packages from
        different companies and organizations. These organizations operate
        asynchronously, introducing and upgrading their products according to
        their own schedules. Distribution of upgraded products takes time and
        adoption is not universal. </P>
      
      <P>In Java, the components of local and distributed systems rely on the
        public interfaces and contracts for the behavior of other packages.
        Those packages will themselves evolve over time. In order for a package
        to operate correctly, packages that it depends upon must continue to
        provide the expected behavior even if those packages have been updated.
      </P>
      
      <P>Only partial consistency is possible in distributed systems, since it
        is impossible to have knowledge of the entire state of the system. Each
        process and each package of the system has its own partial view of the
        current state of the system, accumulated incrementally by requesting
        information from other parts of the distributed system. Each piece of
        information, whether from an applet that was started, a class that was
        loaded, a remote method invoked, or a web page retrieved, must be
        treated carefully so that it can be used consistently with the rest of
        that partial view. </P>
      
      <P>Several types of errors can result from inconsistencies in the classes
        that are loaded: class verification errors, classes compute incorrectly
        but without recognizable errors, or user requested functions that
        exhibit arbitrary failures. </P>
      
      <P>These problems can occur in the following typical scenarios: </P>
      <UL>
        <LI>A running applet has loaded only some of its classes when the web
          server is updated with a newer version. When the applet incrementally
          loads additional classes, these classes could be inconsistent with
          ones that have already been loaded.</LI>
        <LI>An application using libraries from multiple websites has loaded
          only some of the classes it needs. If the libraries are updated, there
          is a potential for incompatibilities that either the applet or the
          user needs to detect.</LI>
        <LI>A running application or applet makes an RMI call that returns an
          object which the class needs to be loaded. The class that is loaded
          could be inconsistent with other already loaded classes.</LI>
        <LI>A running application or applet makes a RMI call that returns an
          object that is for a newer or an older version of the class.</LI>
        <LI>Bugs exist in a library. If the clients have worked around the bug,
          a cascade of problems could be introduced when the bug is fixed.</LI>
      </UL>
      
      <P>These problems cannot be prevented or solved directly because they
        arise out of inconsistencies between dynamically loaded packages that
        are not under the control of a single system administrator and so cannot
        be addressed by current configuration management techniques. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      
      <P>The key to dealing with these problems and meeting the requirements
        stated above is the careful design of the packages and packaging of the
        system so that they may be updated, distributed, and loaded in
        consistent units. Typical to mass produced products is the notion of the
        field replaceable unit. It is the smallest unit of a product that can be
        identified with a specification, a supplier, can be distributed and
        redistributed, and can be replaced if faulty. This same model is used
        for software distribution, products have a name, a version number,
        adhere to one or more specifications, are distributed on the network or
        CD-ROM and its problems can be reported to support organizations. These
        packages are the smallest unit that can be distributed, used, validated
        and replaced or upgraded when necessary. Packages can be assembled with
        other packages and each package can still be identified, verified, and
        distributed. </P>
      
      <P>The Java language-based package mechanism fits well with the idea of a
        replaceable unit. Java packages expose only public interfaces and use
        only the public interfaces of other packages. The Java<FONT SIZE="-3"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT>
        Language Specification defines the approaches for compatible evolution
        of packages. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
    
    <H3><A NAME="JLSonBackwardCompatibility"></A>Java Language Specification
    on Backwards Compatibility</H3>
    
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      
      <P>The Java Language Specification lays the groundwork for developing
        packages that can be expected to evolve gracefully over time. It defines
        how classes can change and still be backward compatible with other
        classes previously compiled and distributed. Essential to robust
        evolution is the stability of the public, protected, and package
        interfaces and behavior as the implementations evolve. It defines &quot;compatible&quot;
        changes as &quot;those changes that do not change existing interfaces or
        behavior.&quot; Thus, if a class defines a method, and the method had a
        particular behavior, that same contract must be supported by the all
        later evolutions of the class. Detailed rules are given in
        <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/html/13.doc.html">Chapter 13</A>
        of the Java<FONT SIZE="-3"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT> Language
        Specification. One additional incompatible change has been added: it is
        incompatible to add methods to a public interface. </P>
      
      <P>Although incompatible changes are not permitted, new or similar
        functionality can always be added in new or existing interfaces or
        classes. </P>
      
      <P>By choosing the Java package as the unit of update, the package and
        private methods of the classes can change, thereby allowing flexibility
        in the implementation of the package while the public and protected
        classes and methods maintain the external interfaces and semantics. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>

      <P>Robust persistent storage and robust communication between the

      <P>Open systems are based on the idea that a specification may have

        organization or company. It is highly undesirable if a specification has
        multiple incompatible versions. Each version of a specification or
        implementation must evolve only into a single subsequent version. The
        philosophy of requiring specifications to be backward compatible allows
        specifications to be identified as supersets of the previous
        specification. Since there is a single sequence of version
        specifications they can meaningfully be identified by version numbers
        with specific semantics that imply the ordering. Specification version

        Runtime, a standard extension, an applet or application package. </P>
      
      <P>Unlike version numbers for specifications, version information for
        implementations cannot be used to identify the package as being backward
        compatible with earlier versions. Package version numbers are present to
        identify differences between the specification and the implementation,
        i.e. bugs. New versions of implementations are specifically produced to
        remove (undesirable or incorrect) behavior and thus are intended not to
        be backward compatible. Therefore, package version strings can have any
        unique value and can only be compared for equality. For a complete
        explanation of this rationale, see
        <A HREF="#RationaleLimitingImplVersionNumbers">Rationale for Limiting
          Implementation Version Numbers to Identity</A>. </P>
      
      <P>The following attribute names are defined for a package. The value of
        each attribute is a string:</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

      <P>The current manifest format is extended to allow the specification of
        the attributes for package versioning information. A manifest entry
        should be created for each Java<FONT SIZE="-3"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT>
        package. The name of the entry will be the directory within the archive
        that contains the package's class and resource files. For example: </P>

      <P>To insert these attributes in the manifest, create a prototype
        manifest file and use JarTool's <TT>-m</TT> switch to merge the
        attributes into the manifest when the manifest is built. JarTool will be
        extended to browse and set the versioning attributes in the manifest.

      <P>Implementations evolve independently over time to fix bugs, to improve
        performance, or to add new functions that are called for by more recent
        revisions of the specifications. Packages implement specifications and
        must identify which version of each specification they implement.
        Interactions occur between packages through their public and protected
        interfaces and classes only. The <I>public</I> API and behavior must
        remain stable over time, so changes can be allowed in the implementation
        of one package without affecting the behavior of another package. </P>
      
      <P>If the classes of a package always faithfully implemented the
        specification, it would be sufficient just to identify the
        specification. Since in the real world this rarely happens, packages
        need to identify themselves so that bugs can be reported against the
        packages that may have contributed to the problem. </P>
      
      <P>There is a significant tendency to try to attach some significance to
        version identifiers of implementations. If the purpose is to allow the
        tracking of bugs then a unique number is sufficient. It is also
        sufficient for a client package to workaround a bug in a particular
        version of a vendors package since that version can be tested for and
        the bug avoided. </P>
      
      <P>However, many additional problems can occur when one package attempts
        to work around bugs in other packages. They need to identify behavior
        that is not part of the specification and may try to use behavior that
        is only part of one implementation. Such implementation specific
        behavior cannot be relied upon to be in any particular version other
        than the one(s) seen and tested by the developer. </P>
      
      <P>A bug first appears in some version of a vendors package and may or
        may not continue to be a problem in subsequent versions. If the client
        of the buggy package uses a workaround based on version numbers, it
        could correctly work around the bug in the specific version. Now, if the
        buggy package was fixed, how would the client package know whether the
        bug was fixed or not? If it assumed that higher versions still contained
        the bug, it would still try to work around the bug. The workaround
        itself might not work correctly with the non-buggy package. This could
        cause a cascade of bugs caused by fixing a bug. Only the developer,
        through testing with a new version, can determine whether or not the
        workaround for a bug is still necessary or whether it will cause
        problems with the correctly behaving package. The developer only knows
        that the bug exists in a particular individual versions. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
