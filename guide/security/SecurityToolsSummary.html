Summary of Tools for the Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> 2 Platform Security
</H2>

<b>Last Modified:  <em>19 October, 1998</em></b>

<P>Below is a brief summary of the Security Tools, with links to
the more detailed documentation.

<p>The <b>keytool</b>, <b>jar</b>, <b>jarsigner</b>, and
<b>Policy Tool</b> tools are available to facilitate various
security-related operations. All are command-line tools, except for
<b>Policy Tool</b>, which has a graphical user interface.
(Note: the <b>jar</b> tool was also available in JDK 1.1.)

<p>The <b>keytool</b> and <b>jarsigner</b> tools replace
<b>javakey</b>, which was an interim tool introduced in JDK 1.1. 
These new tools provide more features than <b>javakey</b>,
including the ability to protect the keystore and private keys
with passwords, and the ability to verify signed JAR files in addition
to generating them. The new
keystore architecture replaces the identity database that <b>javakey</b>
created and managed. It is possible to import the information from
an identity database into a keystore, via a <b>keytool</b> command.


<H2>The Tools</H2>

<blockquote>

<H3><b>keytool</b> 
(<a href="../../tooldocs/solaris/keytool.html">for Solaris</a>) (<a href="../../tooldocs/win32/keytool.html">for Windows</a>)</H3>

<blockquote>

<p>Use <b>keytool</b> to manage your keystore, for example to

<ul>
<li>create public/private key pairs
<li>issue certificate
requests (which you send to the appropriate Certification Authority)
<li>import certificate replies (obtained from the Certification Authority
you contacted)
<li>designate public keys belonging to other parties as
trusted 
</ul>

<p>Keys and certificates are 
used to digitally sign your applications and applets (see
<b>jarsigner</b> below).  A <i>keystore</i> is
a protected database that holds keys and certificates for an enterprise.
Access to a keystore is guarded by a password (defined at the time
the keystore is created, by the person who creates the keystore, and
changeable only when providing the current password).  In
addition, each private key in a keystore can be guarded by
its own password.

</blockquote>


<H3><b>jar</b> 
(<a href="../../tooldocs/solaris/jar.html">for Solaris</a>) (<a href="../../tooldocs/win32/jar.html">for Windows</a>)</H3>

<blockquote>

<p>Use the <b>jar</b> tool to create JAR files. 

<p>The Java ARchive (JAR) file format enables you to bundle multiple files 
into a single archive file. Typically a JAR file will contain the class files
and auxiliary resources associated with applets and applications. When you 
want to "digitally sign" code, you use the <b>jar</b> tool to place it 
in a JAR file and the <b>jarsigner</b> tool to sign the JAR file 
(after generating or importing appropriate keys into your keystore using 
<b>keytool</b>).

</blockquote>


<H3><b>jarsigner</b> 
(<a href="../../tooldocs/solaris/jarsigner.html">for Solaris</a>) (<a href="../../tooldocs/win32/jarsigner.html">for Windows</a>)</H3>

<blockquote>

<p>Use the <b>jarsigner</b> tool to sign JAR files, or to verify signatures on
signed JAR files.  

<p>The <b>jarsigner</b> tool accesses a keystore that is created and 
managed by <b>keytool</b>, when it needs to find
the private key and its associated certificate chain
to use when signing a JAR file.  Since accesses to the
keystore and to private keys are protected by passwords, only 
people who know the
passwords will be able to access the key and use it to sign
a JAR file.  The <b>jarsigner</b> tool prompts for needed passwords.

</blockquote>


<H3><b>Policy Tool</b> 
(<a href="../../tooldocs/solaris/policytool.html">for Solaris</a>) (<a href="../../tooldocs/win32/policytool.html">for Windows</a>)</H3>

<blockquote>

<p>Use the <b>Policy Tool</b> (invoked by using the <code>policytool</code> 
command) to create and modify the external policy
configuration files that define your installation's security
policy.
 
<p>The policy is described in the
<a href="spec/security-spec.doc.html">
<b>Security Architecture Specification</b></a>. Further
information is provided in
<a href="PolicyFiles.html">
<b>Default Policy Implementation and Policy File Syntax</b></a>.

<p>This tool has a graphical user interface, so you select buttons and
other options rather than type in commands as for the other tools. 

</blockquote>

<H2>Examples of Use of the Tools</H2>

<blockquote>

Examples of the use of the security tools can be found in the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/security1.2/index.html">
<b>Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> 2 Platform Security</b></a> trail of the
