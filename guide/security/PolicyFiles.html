<H1>Default Policy Implementation and Policy File Syntax</H1>



<b>Last Modified:  <em>30 October, 1998</em></b>

</center>



<p>The policy for a Java application environment (specifying which permissions 
are available for code from various sources) is represented 
by a Policy object. More specifically, it is represented by a
<code>Policy</code> subclass providing an implementation
of the abstract methods in the <code>Policy</code> class (which is 
in the <code>java.security</code> package).

<p>The source location for the policy information utilized by the
Policy object is up to the Policy implementation.
The default Policy implementation obtains its
information from static policy configuration files.

The rest of this document pertains to the default Policy
implementation and the syntax that must be used
in policy files it reads.
For information about using the <b>Policy Tool</b> to create
a policy file (without needing to know the required syntax),
see the Policy Tool documentation
(<a href="../../tooldocs/solaris/policytool.html">for Solaris</a>) (<a href="../../tooldocs/win32/policytool.html">for Windows</a>).

<H2><a name="DefaultImpl">Default Policy Implementation</a></H2>

<blockquote>

In the default Policy implementation, the policy can be specified within one 
or more policy configuration files. The configuration file(s) specify what 
permissions are allowed for code from specified code sources.

<p>A policy file can be composed via a simple text editor, or via 
the graphical <b>Policy Tool</b> utility. 

<p>There is by default a single system-wide policy file, and a 
single (optional) user policy file.

<p>The default Policy object is initialized the first time its 
<code>getPermissions</code> method is called, or whenever its
<code>refresh</code> method is called.
Initialization involves parsing the policy configuration file(s)
(see <a href = "#FileSyntax">Policy File Syntax</a>), and 
then populating the Policy object. 

</blockquote>


<H2><a name="DefaultLocs">Default Policy File Locations</a></H2>

<blockquote>

<p>As mentioned previously, there is by default a single system-wide policy file, and a single user policy file.

<p>The system policy file is by default located at

<blockquote>
<pre>
<i>java.home</i>/lib/security/java.policy  (Solaris)
<i>java.home</i>\lib\security\java.policy  (Windows)
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Note: <i>java.home</i> refers to the value of the system 
property named "java.home", which specifies the directory that 
houses the runtime environment -- either the <tt>jre</tt> 
directory in the Java 2 SDK or the top-level directory of 
the Java 2 Runtime Environment.

<p>The system policy file is 
meant to grant system-wide code permissions. 
The <code>java.policy</code> file installed with the SDK grants all permissions
to standard extensions, allows anyone to listen on un-privileged ports, and
allows any code to read certain "standard" properties that are not security-sensitive, 
such as the "os.name" and "file.separator" properties.

<p>The user policy file is by default located at

<blockquote>
<pre>
<i>user.home</i>/.java.policy  (Solaris)
<i>user.home</i>\.java.policy  (Windows)
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Note: <i>user.home</i> refers to the value of the system 
property named "user.home", which specifies the 
user's home directory. On Windows systems, 
given user name <i>uName</i>, the "user.home"
property value defaults to

<blockquote>
<pre>
C:\Winnt\Profiles\uName on multi-user Windows NT systems
C:\Windows\Profiles\uName on multi-user Windows 95 systems
C:\Windows on single-user Windows 95 systems
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>When the Policy is initialized, the system policy is loaded in first, and 
then the user policy is added to it. If neither policy is present, a built-in 
policy is used.  This built-in policy is the same as the original sandbox policy.

<p>Policy file locations are specified in the security properties file, 
which is located at

<blockquote>
<pre>
<i>java.home</i>/lib/security/java.security  (Solaris)
<i>java.home</i>\lib\security\java.security  (Windows)
</pre>
</blockquote>

As noted above, <i>java.home</i> indicates the directory that houses 
the runtime environment -- either the <tt>jre</tt> directory in the 
Java 2 SDK or the top-level directory of the Java 2 Runtime Environment.

The policy file locations are specified as the values of properties 
whose names are of the form

<blockquote>
<pre>
policy.url.<i>n</i>
</pre>
</blockquote>

where <i>n</i> is a number. You specify each such property 
value in a line of the following form:

<blockquote>
<pre>
policy.url.<i>n</i>=<i>URL</i>
</pre>
</blockquote>

Here, <i>URL</i> is a URL specification.

<p>For example, the default system and user policy 
files are defined in the security properties file as

<blockquote>
<pre>
policy.url.1=file:${java.home}/lib/security/java.policy
policy.url.2=file:${user.home}/.java.policy
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>(See <a href = "#PropertyExp">Property Expansion</a> for
information about specifying property values via a special syntax, such as 
specifying the <i>java.home</i> property value via <i>${java.home}</i>.)

<p>You can actually specify a number of URLs (including ones of the form "http://"), 
and all the designated policy files will get loaded. You can also comment out or
change the second one to disable reading the default user policy file.

<p>The algorithm starts at policy.url.1, and keeps incrementing until it does not 
find a URL. Thus if you have policy.url.1 and policy.url.3, policy.url.3 will 
never be read.

<H3>Specifying an Additional Policy File at Runtime</H3>

<blockquote>

<p>It is also possible to specify an additional or a different policy file when 
invoking execution of an application. This can be done via the 
"-Djava.security.policy" command line argument, which sets the value of 
the <i>java.security.policy</i> property. For example, if you use

<pre>
    java -Djava.security.manager -Djava.security.policy=<i>someURL</i> SomeApp
</pre>

where <i>someURL</i> is a URL specifying the location of a policy file, 
then the specified policy 
file will be loaded in addition to all the policy files that are specified in 
the security properties file. 

<p>Notes:

<ul>
<li>The URL can be any regular URL or simply the name of a policy file 
in the current directory, as in

<pre>
    java -Djava.security.manager -Djava.security.policy=mypolicy WriteFile
</pre>
<p>

<li>The "-Djava.security.manager" argument ensures 
that the default security manager is installed, and thus the application is 
subject to policy checks. It is not required if the application <i>SomeApp</i>
installs a security manager.
</ul> 

<p>If you use

<pre>
    java -Djava.security.manager -Djava.security.policy==<i>someURL</i> SomeApp
</pre>

(note the double equals) then <i>just</i> the specified policy file 
will be used; all the ones indicated in the security properties
file will be ignored.

<p>If you want to pass a policy file to the appletviewer, then use a 
"-J-Djava.security.policy" argument as follows:

<pre>
    appletviewer -J-Djava.security.policy=<i>someURL</i> myApplet
</pre>

Please note: The "-Djava.security.policy" policy file value will be 
ignored (for both <code>java</code> and <code>appletviewer</code> commands) 
if the "policy.allowSystemProperty" property in the security properties file 
is set to false. The default is true.

</blockquote>

</blockquote>


<H2><a name="ChangingDefault">Changing the Policy Implementation</a></H2>

<blockquote>

<p>An alternative policy class can be given to replace the default Policy 
implementation class, as long as the former is a subclass of the abstract 
Policy class and implements the <code>getPermissions</code> method 
(and other methods as necessary).

<p>The default Policy implementation can be changed by editing the security 
properties file, which is the
<code>java.security</code> file in the <code>lib/security</code> 
directory of the SDK.

<p>One of the types of properties you can set in <code>java.security</code>
is of the following form:

<pre>
    policy.provider=<i>PolicyClassName</i>
</pre>

<p><i>PolicyClassName</i> must specify the fully qualified name
of the desired Policy implementation class. The default security properties 
file entry for this property is the following:

<pre>
    policy.provider=sun.security.provider.PolicyFile
</pre>

<p>To customize, you can change the property value to specify another class, as in

<pre>
   policy.provider=com.mycom.MyPolicy
</pre>

</blockquote>



<H2><a name="FileSyntax">Policy File Syntax</a></H2>

<blockquote>

<p>The policy configuration file(s) for a SDK installation
specify what permissions (which types of system resource accesses) are
allowed by code from specified code sources.
 
<p>In order for an applet (or an application running under a security
manager) to be allowed to perform secured actions (such as reading or 
writing a file), the applet (or application) must be
granted permission for that particular action.
In the default Policy implementation, that permission must be
granted by a grant entry in a policy configuration file.
See below and the <a href="spec/security-spec.doc.html"> 
"Java Security Architecture Specification"</a>
for more information.
(The only exception is that code always automatically has permission to 
read files from its same (URL) location, and subdirectories 
of that location; it does not need explicit permission to do so.)

<p>A policy configuration file essentially contains a list of entries. 
It may contain a "keystore" entry, and contains zero or more "grant" entries.


<H3>Keystore Entry</H3>

<blockquote>

<p>A <i>keystore</i> is a database of private keys and their associated digital 
certificates such as X.509 certificate chains authenticating the corresponding 
public keys. 
The <b>keytool</b> utility 
(<a href="../../tooldocs/solaris/keytool.html">for Solaris</a>)
(<a href="../../tooldocs/win32/keytool.html">for Windows</a>)
is used to create and administer keystores. The keystore specified in a policy 
configuration file is used to look up the public keys of the signers specified 
in the grant entries of the file. A keystore entry must appear in a policy 
configuration file if any grant entries specify signer aliases (see below).

<p>At this time, there can be only one <b>keystore entry</b> in the policy file 
(others after the first one are ignored), and it can appear anywhere outside 
the file's grant entries. It has the following syntax:

<pre>
    keystore "some_keystore_url", "keystore_type";
</pre>

where "some_keystore_url" specifies the URL location of the keystore, and "keystore_type" specifies the keystore type. 

<p>The URL is relative to the policy file location. Thus if the policy file 
is specified in the security properties file as:

<pre>
    policy.url.1=http://foo.bar.com/fum/some.policy
</pre>

and that policy file has an entry:

<pre>
    keystore ".keystore";
</pre>

then the keystore will be loaded from:

<pre>
    http://foo.bar.com/fum/.keystore
</pre>

The URL can also be absolute.

<p>A <b>keystore type</b> defines the storage and data format of the 
keystore information,
and the algorithms used to protect private keys in the keystore and the integrity 
of the keystore itself. The default type supported by Sun Microsystems is a 
proprietary keystore type named "JKS". Thus, if the keystore type is
"JKS", it does not need to be specified in the keystore entry.

</blockquote>


<H3>Grant Entries</H3>
 
<blockquote>

<p>Code being executed is always considered to come from a particular
"code source" (represented by an object of type CodeSource). 
The code source includes not only the location (URL)
where the code originated from, but also a reference to the certificate(s)
containing the public key(s) 
corresponding to the private key(s) used to sign the code.
Certificates in a code source are referenced by symbolic alias
names from the user's keystore.

<p>Each <b>grant entry</b> includes one or more "permission entries"
preceded by optional <code>codeBase</code> and <code>signedBy</code> 
name/value pairs that specify which code you want to grant the permissions.
The basic format of a grant entry is the following:

<pre>
  grant signedBy "<i>signer_names</i>", codeBase "<i>URL</i>" {
    permission <i>permission_class_name</i> "<i>target_name</i>", "<i>action</i>", 
        signedBy "<i>signer_names</i>";
    ....
    permission <i>permission_class_name</i> "<i>target_name</i>", "<i>action</i>", 
        signedBy "<i>signer_names</i>";
  };
 	
</pre>

All non-italicized items above must appear as is (although case 
doesn't matter and some are optional, as noted below).
Italicized items represent variable values.

<p> A grant entry must begin with the word <code>grant</code>.


<H3>The SignedBy and CodeBase Fields</H3>

<blockquote>

<p>The <code>signedBy</code> and <code>codeBase</code> name/value 
pairs are optional, and the order between these fields does not matter. 

<p>A <code>signedBy</code> 
value indicates the alias for a certificate stored in the keystore.
The public key within that certificate is used to verify the digital
signature on the code; you grant
the permission(s) to code signed by the private key corresponding
to the public key in the keystore entry specified by the alias.

<p>The <code>signedBy</code> value can be a comma-separated list of 
multiple aliases. An example is "Adam,Eve,Charles", which 
means "signed by Adam and Eve and Charles"; the relationship is AND, 
not OR. To be more exact, a statement like "Code signed by Adam"
means "Code in a class file contained in a JAR file, where the JAR
file was signed using the private key corresponding to the 
public key that appears in a keystore certificate in an entry 
aliased by Adam."

<p>The <code>signedBy</code> field is optional in that, if it is omitted, 
it signifies "any signer". It doesn't matter whether 
the code is signed or not or by whom.

<p>A <code>codeBase</code> value indicates the code source location; 
you grant the permission(s) to code from that location.
An empty <code>codeBase</code> entry signifies
"any code"; it doesn't matter where the code originates from.

<p>Note: a <code>codeBase</code> value is a URL and thus should always utilize 
slashes (never backslashes) as the directory separator, even when 
the code source is actually on a Windows system. Thus, if the source
location for code on a Windows system is actually 
<code>C:\somepath\api\</code>, then 
the policy <code>codeBase</code> entry should look like:

<pre>
    grant codeBase "file:/C:/somepath/api/" {
      ...
    }
</pre>

The exact meaning of a <code>codeBase</code> value depends on the
characters at the end. A <code>codeBase</code> with a trailing "/"
matches all class files (not JAR files) in the specified directory.
A <code>codeBase</code> with a trailing "/*" matches 
all files (both class and JAR files) contained in that directory.
A <code>codeBase</code> with a trailing "/-" matches 
all files (both class and JAR files) in the directory and 
recursively all files in subdirectories contained in that directory.
The following table illustrates the different cases.

<p>

<table border=1 cellpadding=5>
<tr>
<th>Codebase URL of  Downloaded Code</th>
<th>Codebase URL in Policy</th>
<th>Match?</th>

<H3>The Permission Entries</H3>

<blockquote>

<p> A <b>permission entry</b> must begin with the word 
<code>permission</code>. 
The word <code><i>permission_class_name</i></code> in the template above 
would actually be a specific permission type, such as <code>java.io.FilePermission</code>
or <code>java.lang.RuntimePermission</code>.

<p>The "<i>action</i>" is required for
many permission types, such as <code>java.io.FilePermission</code>
(where it specifies what type of file access is permitted).
It is not required for categories such as 
<code>java.lang.RuntimePermission</code>
where it is not necessary - you either have the 
permission specified by the <code>"<i>target_name</i>"</code> 
value following the <i>permission_class_name</i> or you don't.

<p>The <code>signedBy</code> name/value pair for a permission entry 
is optional. If present, it indicates a signed permission. That is,
the permission class itself must be signed by the given alias(es) in
order for the permission to be granted. For example,
suppose you have the following grant entry:

<pre>
  grant {
    permission Foo "foobar", signedBy "FooSoft";
  }
</pre>

<p>Then this permission of type <i>Foo</i> is granted if the 
<code>Foo.class</code> permission was placed in a JAR file and the
JAR file was signed by the private
key corresponding to the public key in the certificate
specified by the 
"FooSoft" alias, or if <code>Foo.class</code> is a 
system class, since system classes are not subject 
to policy restrictions.

<p>Items that appear in a permission entry must appear in the specified 
order (<code>permission</code>, <i>permission_class_name</i>, 
"<i>target_name</i>", "<i>action</i>", and 
<code>signedBy</code> "<i>signer_names</i>"). 
An entry is terminated with a semicolon.

<p>Case is unimportant for the identifiers (<code>permission</code>, 
<code>signedBy</code>, <code>codeBase</code>, etc.) but is 
significant for the <i>permission_class_name</i>
or for any string that is passed in as a value. 

</blockquote>


<H3>Note Regarding File Path Specifications on Windows Systems</H3>

<blockquote>

<p>Please note: When you are specifying a <code>java.io.FilePermission</code>,
the "<i>target_name</i>" is a file path. On Windows systems, whenever you 
directly specify a file path in a string (but not in a codeBase URL), 
you need to include two backslashes 
for each actual single backslash in the path, as in

<pre>
  grant {
      permission java.io.FilePermission "C:\\users\\cathy\\foo.bat", "read";
  };
</pre>

The reason this is necessary is because the strings are processed by a 
tokenizer (java.io.StreamTokenizer), which allows "\" to be used as an 
escape string (for example, "\n" to indicate a new line)
and which thus requires two backslashes to indicate a single backslash. 
After the tokenizer has processed the above file path string, converting 
double backslashes to single backslashes, the end result is 

<pre>
    "C:\users\cathy\foo.bat"
</pre>

</blockquote>

</blockquote>

</blockquote>



<H2><a name="Examples">Policy File Examples</a></H2>

<blockquote>

<p>An example of two entries in a policy configuration file is
<pre>
  // If the code is signed by "Duke", grant it read/write access to all 
  // files in /tmp:

  grant signedBy "Duke" {
    permission java.io.FilePermission "/tmp/*", "read,write";
  };
<p>	
  // Grant everyone the following permission:

  grant { 
    permission java.util.PropertyPermission "java.vendor";
  };
 </pre>

<p>The contents of another sample policy configuration file appear below.
  
<pre>
  grant signedBy "sysadmin", codeBase "file:/home/sysadmin/*" {
    permission java.security.SecurityPermission "Security.insertProvider.*";
    permission java.security.SecurityPermission "Security.removeProvider.*";
    permission java.security.SecurityPermission "Security.setProperty.*";
  };
</pre>

This specifies that <i>only</i> code that satisfies the following
conditions can call methods in the Security class to 
add or remove providers or to set Security properties:

<ul>
<li>The code was loaded from a signed 
JAR file that is in the "/home/sysadmin/" directory
on the local file system.
<li>The signature can be verified using the public key
referenced by the alias name "sysadmin" in the 
keystore.
</ul>

<p>Either component of the code source (or both) may be missing. An 
example where <code>codeBase</code> is missing is:

<pre>
  grant signedBy "sysadmin" {
    permission java.security.SecurityPermission "Security.insertProvider.*";
    permission java.security.SecurityPermission "Security.removeProvider.*";
  };
</pre>

If this policy is in effect, code that comes in a JAR File signed by "sysadmin"
can add/remove providers, regardless of where the JAR File originated
from.

<p>An example without a signer is:

<pre>
  grant codeBase "file:/home/sysadmin/-" {
    permission java.security.SecurityPermission "Security.insertProvider.*";
    permission java.security.SecurityPermission "Security.removeProvider.*";
  };
</pre>

In this case, code that comes from anywhere beneath the "/home/sysadmin/"
directory on the local filesystem can add/remove providers. The code does
not need to be signed.

<p>An example where neither <code>codeBase</code> nor 
<code>signedBy</code> is included is:

<pre>
  grant {
    permission java.security.SecurityPermission "Security.insertProvider.*";
    permission java.security.SecurityPermission "Security.removeProvider.*";
  };
</pre>

Here, with both code source components missing, any code (regardless of where
it originated from, or whether or not it is signed, or who signed
it) can add/remove providers.


</blockquote>

<H2><a name="PropertyExp">Property Expansion in Policy Files</a></H2>

<blockquote>

Property expansion is possible in policy files and in the security properties file.

<p>Property expansion is similar to expanding variables in a shell. That is, when 
a string like

<pre>
    ${some.property}
</pre>

appears in a policy file, or in the security properties file, it will be expanded 
to the value of the system property. For example,

<pre>
    permission java.io.FilePermission "${user.home}", "read";
</pre>

will expand "${user.home}" to use the value of the "user.home" system 
property. If that property's value is "/home/cathy", then the above is equivalent to

<pre>
    permission java.io.FilePermission "/home/cathy", "read";
</pre>

In order to assist in platform-independent policy files, you can also use the 
special notation of "${/}", which is a shortcut for "${file.separator}". 
This allows things like

<pre>
    permission java.io.FilePermission "${user.home}${/}*", "read";
</pre>

If the value of the "user.home" property is <code>/home/cathy</code>, 
and you are on Solaris, the above gets converted to:

<pre>
    permission java.io.FilePermission "/home/cathy/*", "read";
</pre>

If on the other hand the "user.home" value is <code>C:\users\cathy</code>
and you are on a Windows system, the above gets converted to:

<pre>
    permission java.io.FilePermission "C:\users\cathy\*", "read";
</pre>

Also, as a special case, if you expand a property in a codebase, such as

<pre>
    grant codeBase "file:${java.home}/lib/ext/"
</pre>

then any file.separator characters will be automatically converted to /'s. 
Thus on a Windows system, the above would get converted to

<pre>
    grant codeBase "file:C:/jdk1.3/jre/lib/ext/"
</pre>

even if "java.home" is set to <code>C:\jdk1.3\jre</code>. Thus you don't need to use 
${/} in codebase strings (and you shouldn't).

<p>Property expansion takes place anywhere a double quoted string is allowed 
in the policy file. This includes the <i>"signer_names"</i>, <i>"URL"</i>,
<i>"target_name"</i>, and <i>"action"</i> fields.

<p>Whether or not property expansion is allowed is controlled by the value 
of the  "policy.expandProperties" property in the security properties 
file. If the value of this property is true (the default), expansion is 
allowed.

<p>Please note: You can't use nested properties; they will not work. For example, 

<pre>
    "${user.${foo}}"
</pre>

doesn't work, even if the "foo" property is set to "home". 
The reason is the property parser doesn't recognize nested properties; 
it simply looks for the first "${", and then keeps looking until it finds 
the first "}" and tries to interpret the result (in this case, "${user.$foo}")
as a property, but fails if there is no such property.

<p>Also note: If a property can't be expanded in a grant entry, permission 
entry, or keystore entry, that entry is ignored. For example, if the 
system property "foo" is not defined and you have:

<pre>
    grant codeBase "${foo}" {
      permission ...;
      permission ...;
    };
</pre>

then all the permissions in this grant entry are ignored. If you have

<pre>
    grant {
      permission Foo "${foo}";
      permission Bar;
    };
</pre>

then only the "permission Foo..." entry is ignored. And finally, if you have

<pre>
    keystore "${foo}";
</pre>

then the keystore entry is ignored.


<H3>Windows Systems, File Paths, and Property Expansion</H3>

<blockquote>

As noted above, on Windows systems, when you directly 
specify a file path 
in a string (but not in a codeBase URL), you need to include two backslashes 
for each actual single backslash in the path, as in

<pre>
    grant {
        permission java.io.FilePermission "C:\\users\\cathy\\foo.bat", "read";
    };
</pre>

This is because the strings are processed by a tokenizer (java.io.StreamTokenizer),
which allows "\" to be used as an escape string (e.g., "\n" to indicate a new line)
and which thus requires two backslashes to indicate a single backslash. After the 
tokenizer has processed the above file path string, converting double backslashes 
to single backslashes, the end result is 

<pre>
    "C:\users\cathy\foo.bat"
</pre>

Expansion of a property in a string takes place after the tokenizer has processed 
the string. Thus if you have the string

<pre>
    "${user.home}\\foo.bat"
</pre>

then first the tokenizer processes the string, converting the double backslashes 
to a single backslash, and the result is

<pre>
    "${user.home}\foo.bat"
</pre>

Then the ${user.home} property is expanded and the end result is

<pre>
    "C:\users\cathy\foo.bat"
</pre>

assuming the "user.home<" value is <code>C:\users\cathy</code>. Of course, for 
platform independence, it would be better if the string was initially 
specified without any explicit slashes, i.e., using the ${/} 
property instead, as in

<pre>
    "${user.home}${/}foo.bat"
</pre>
