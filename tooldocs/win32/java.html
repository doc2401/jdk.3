<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2></a>
<blockquote>
The <b>java</b> tool launches a Java application. It does this by
starting a Java runtime environment, loading a
specified class, and invoking that class's <b>main</b> method. The
method declaration must look like the following:
<pre>
    public static void main(String args[])
</pre>
The method must be declared public and static, it must not
return any value, and it must accept a String array as a
parameter. By default, the first non-option argument is the name 
of the class to be invoked. A fully-qualified class name should be used. 
If the <b>-jar</b> option is specified, the first non-option argument 
is the name of a <b>JAR</b> archive containing class and resource files 
for the application, with the startup class indicated by the
<b>Main-Class</b> manifest header.
<p>
The Java runtime searches for the startup class, and other classes
used, in three sets of locations: the bootstrap class path, the
installed extensions, and the user class path.
<p>
Non-option arguments after the class name or JAR file name are passed
to the <b>main</b> function.
<p>
The <b>javaw</b> command is identical to <b>java</b>, except that with 
<b>javaw</b> there is no associated console window. Use <b>javaw</b> when 
you don't want a command prompt window to appear. The <b>javaw</b> 
launcher will, however, display a dialog box with error information 
if a launch fails for some reason.


</blockquote>

<a name="vm">
<h2>The Client VM and the Classic VM</h2>
<blockquote>
The Java 2 SDK and Java 2 Runtime Environment contain two implementations 
of the Java virtual machine. <p>
<b>The Java HotSpot<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> Client VM</b><br>
The Java HotSpot Client VM is the default virtual machine.  Its use of 
Java HotSpot technology gives it superior 
performance to that of the Classic VM. Unless special command-line 
options are used to invoke the Classic VM instead (see below), 
<b>java</b> will always launch an application to run on the 
Client VM.
<p>
<b>The Java 2 Classic VM</b><br>
The Java 2 Classic VM is essentially the same virtual machine 
implementation as in version 1.2 of the Java 2 SDK. It may 
be invoked by using the <tt>-classic</tt> command-line option, as 
in this example:
<blockquote><pre>
java -classic MyApp
</pre></blockquote>
The Java 2 Classic VM is included only in the Java 2 SDK.  It is 
not included in the Java 2 Runtime Environment. The <tt>-classic</tt> 
option will not work with the Java 2 Runtime Environment.
</blockquote>


<a name="oldjava">
<h2>JAVA AND OLDJAVA</h2></a>
<blockquote>
These are the differences between <b>java</b> and <b>oldjava</b>
<ul>
    <li>The <b>oldjava</b> launcher does not support the extension
    mechanism. Extension packages can still be used as class and
    resource archives.
    <p>
    <li>The <b>oldjava</b> launcher uses the bootstrap class loader for
    all classes, while the <b>java</b> launcher uses the bootstrap
    class loader only for bootstrap classes. This allows programming
    techniques that are incompatible with the base class loader.
    <p>
    <li>With <b>java</b>, the <b>-classpath</b> and <b>-cp</b>
    options specify a search path for user classes, and cannot be used
    to specify locations for bootstrap classes. With <b>oldjava</b> the
    <b>-classpath</b> and <b>-cp</b> options specify locations for
    <i>all</i> classes, including bootstrap classes.
    <p>
    Note that <b>java</b> and <b>oldjava</b> do <i>not</i> differ in
    their use of the <b>CLASSPATH</b> environment variable. Unless
    overridden by <b>-classpath</b> or <b>-cp</b>, <b>CLASSPATH</b>
    always specifies the location of user classes, but says nothing
    about the bootstrap classes.
    <p>
    <li>The <b>oldjava</b> launcher supports all the Java 2 platform security 
    features. With <b>oldjava</b>, however, classes loaded from the 
    class path will not have a protection domain and will therefore 
    have all permissions which is true only for bootstrap classes with 
    the <b>java</b> launcher.
</ul>
This command using <b>oldjava</b>
<blockquote><pre>
oldjava -classpath &lt;path&gt; ...
</pre></blockquote>
is equivalent to this command using <b>java</b>
<blockquote><pre>
java -Xbootclasspath:&lt;path&gt; -Djava.ext.dirs= ...
</pre></blockquote>
where in both cases <tt>&lt;path&gt;</tt> contains 
the file <tt>rt.jar</tt>. (See the <a href="jdkfiles.html">SDK File 
Structure</a> document for a description of <tt>rt.jar</tt> and its 
location in the SDK software.)
</blockquote>


<a name="jit">
<h2>USING JIT COMPILERS</h2>
<blockquote>
By default, the Java application launcher runs applications on the 
Java HotSpot Client VM, which is implemented with Java HotSpot technology. 
Just-in-time (JIT) compilers 
cannot be used in conjunction with Java HotSpot Client VM because the 
Java HotSpot architecture makes use of its own optimizing compiler. 
<p>
Applications can optionally be launched using the Java 2 Classic VM
by using the <tt>-classic</tt> option. (The Java 2 Classic VM is 
included only in the Java 2 SDK.  It is not included in the Java 2 
Runtime Environment, and the <tt>-classic</tt> 
option will not work with the Java 2 Runtime Environment.)
<blockquote><pre>
java -classic MyApp
</pre></blockquote>
In this mode, the <tt>JAVA_COMPILER</tt> environment variable can 
be used to specify a JIT compiler to use in conjunction with the 
classic VM.  The <tt>.dll</tt> files for JIT compilers should be 
located in the directory <tt>jre\bin</tt> in the SDK, and in the 
<tt>bin</tt> directory in the Java 2 Runtime 
Environment). If the JIT compiler's file is named <tt>foo.dll</tt>, 
for example, setting <tt>JAVA_COMPILER</tt> equal to "foo", 
would cause the Java launcher to invoke the foo JIT compiler 
when running applications in classic mode. A JIT compiler may 
also be invoked when launching an application on the classic 
VM by setting the <tt>java.compiler</tt> property with a 
command-line switch:
<blockquote><pre>
java -classic -Djava.compiler=foo MyApp
</pre></blockquote>
</blockquote>

<a name="options">
<h2>OPTIONS</h2></a>
<blockquote>
The launcher has a set of <a href="#standard">standard options</a> that 
are supported on the current runtime environment and will be supported in 
future releases.
In addition, the default Java HotSpot Client VM provides a set of 
<a href="#nonstandard">non-standard options</a>. The non-standard options 
are subject to change in future releases.  The Java 2 Classic VM, 
invoked by using the <tt>-classic</tt> option, has a different set of 
non-standard options which are described at 
<a href=java-classic.html>Non-Standard Options of the Classic VM</a>.
The Java 2 Classic VM is included only in the Java 2 SDK.  It is 
not included in the Java 2 Runtime Environment. The <tt>-classic</tt> 
option will not work with the Java 2 Runtime Environment.
</blockquote>

<a name="standard">
<h2>Standard Options</h2></a>
<blockquote>
<dl>
    <dt><b>-classpath</b> <i>classpath</i>
    <dt><b>-cp</b> <i>classpath</i>
	<dd>Specify a list of directories, JAR archives, and ZIP
	archives to search for class files. Class path entries are
	separated by semicolons (<b>;</b>). Specifying
	<b>-classpath</b> or <b>-cp</b> overrides any setting of the
	<b>CLASSPATH</b> environment variable.
	<p>
	Used with <b>java</b> or <b>javaw</b>, <b>-classpath</b> or
	<b>-cp</b> only specify the class path for user classes. Used
	with <b>oldjava</b> or <b>oldjavaw</b>, <b>-classpath</b> or
	<b>-cp</b> specify the class path for both user classes and
	bootstrap classes.
	<p>
	If <b>-classpath</b> and <b>-cp</b> are not used and
	<b>CLASSPATH</b> is not set, the user class path consists of
	the current directory (<b><code>.</code></b>).
	<p>
	For more information on class paths, see 
	<a href=classpath.html>Setting the Class Path</a>.
    <p>
    <dt><b>-D</b><i>property</i><b>=</b><i>value</i>
	<dd>Set a system property value.  If <i>value</i> is a 
        string that contains spaces, you must enclose the string 
        in double quotes:
        <blockquote><pre>
        java -Dfoo="some string" SomeClass
        </pre></blockquote>
    <a name="-jar"></a>
    <dt><b>-jar</b>
	<dd>Execute a program encapsulated in a JAR file. The first
	argument is the name of a JAR file instead of a startup
	class name. In order for this option to work, the manifest of 
        the JAR file must contain a line of the form 
        <b>Main-Class: <i>classname</i></b>. 
        Here, <i>classname</i> identifies the class having the 
        <tt>public&nbsp;static&nbsp;void&nbsp;main(String[]&nbsp;args)</tt> 
        method that serves as your application's starting point. See 
        the <a href="jar.html">Jar tool reference page</a> and 
        the Jar trail of the 
        <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/jar">Java 
        Tutorial</a> for information about working with Jar files and 
        Jar-file manifests.
        <p> 
        When you use this option, the 
        JAR file is the source of all user classes, and other user class 
        path settings are ignored. 
	<p>
	The <b>oldjava</b> and <b>oldjavaw</b> tools do
	not support the <b>-jar</b> option.
    <p>
    <dt><b>-verbose</b>
    <dt><b>-verbose:class</b>
	<dd>Display information about each class loaded.
    <p>
    <dt><b>-verbose:gc</b>
	<dd>Report on each garbage collection event.
    <p>
    <dt><b>-verbose:jni</b>
	<dd>Report information about use of native methods and other
	Java Native Interface activity.
    <p>
    <dt><b>-version</b>
	<dd>Display version information and exit.
    <p>
    <dt><b>-showversion</b>
	<dd>Display version information and continue.
    <p>
    <dt><b>-?</b>
    <dt><b>-help</b>
	<dd>Display usage information and exit.
    <p>
    <dt><b>-X</b>

<a name="nonstandard">
<h3>Non-Standard Options</h3></a>
<blockquote>
<dl>
    <dt><b>-Xmixed</b>
        <dd>Operate in mixed-only mode (the default).  
        This means that heavily used program segments (hot spots) are 
        compiled to native code, and the remaining bytecodes are executed 
        by a bytecode interpreter. This mode provides the fullest 
        performance benefit offered by the Java HotSpot Client VM.

    <p><dt><b>-Xint</b>
        <dd>Operate in interpreted-only mode. Compilation to native code 
        is disabled, and all bytecodes are executed by the interpreter. 
        The performance benefits offered by the Java HotSpot Client VM's 
        adaptive compiler will not be present in this mode.

    <p>
    <dt><b>-Xdebug</b>
        <dd>Start with the debugger enabled.   Refer to 
        <a href="jdb.html#description">jdb description</a> for more 
        details and an example.

    <p><dt><b>-Xbootclasspath:</b><i>bootclasspath</i>
	<dd>Specify a semicolon-separated list of directories, JAR
	archives, and ZIP archives to search for boot class files.
	These are used in place of the boot class files included in the
	Java 2 SDK. <em>Note: Applications that use this option for the 
        purpose of overriding a class in rt.jar should not be deployed 
        as doing so would contravene the Java 2 Runtime Environment 
        binary code license.</em>
    <p><dt><b>-Xbootclasspath/a:</b><i>path</i>
        <dd>Specify a semicolon-separated path of directires, JAR 
        archives, and ZIP archives to append to the default bootstrap 
        class path. 
    <p><dt><b>-Xbootclasspath/p:</b><i>path</i>
        <dd>Specify a semicolon-separated path of directires, JAR 
        archives, and ZIP archives to prepend in front of the default 
        bootstrap class path. <em>Note: Applications that use this option 
        for the purpose of overriding a class in rt.jar should not be 
        deployed as doing so would contravene the Java 2 Runtime Environment 
        binary code license.</em>
    <p>
    <dt><b>-Xfuture</b>
        <dd>Perform strict class-file format checks. For purposes of backwards 
        compatibility, the default format checks performed by the 
        Java 2 SDK's virtual machine are no stricter than 
        the checks performed by 1.1.x versions of the JDK software. The 
        <b>-Xfuture</b> flag turns on stricter class-file format checks 
        that enforce closer conformance to the class-file format 
        specification. Developers are encouraged to use this flag 
        when developing new code because the stricter checks will 
        become the default in future releases of the Java application 
        launcher.
    <p>
    <dt><b>-Xnoclassgc</b>
	<dd>Disable class garbage collection.
    <p>
    <p><dt><b>-Xincgc</b>
        <dd>
        Enable the incremental garbage collector. The incremental 
        garbage collector, which is off by default, will eliminate 
        occasional garbage-collection pauses during program execution. 
        However, it can lead to a roughly 10% decrease in overall 
        GC performance.
     <p>
<a name="Xms">
    <dt><b>-Xms</b><i>n</i>
	<dd>Specify the initial size, in bytes, of the memory allocation pool. 
        This value must be a multiple of 1024 greater than 1MB. Append the 
        letter <tt>k</tt> or <tt>K</tt> to indicate kilobytes, or <tt>m</tt> 
        or <tt>M</tt> to indicate megabytes. The default value is 2MB.  
       Examples: 
       <blockquote><pre>

       <dd> 
       Profiles the running program, and sends profiling data to 
       standard output. This option is provided as a utility that 
       is useful in program development and is not intended to be 
       be used in production systems.
    <p>
    <dt><b>-Xrunhprof</b>[:<i>help</i>][:<i>&lt;suboption&gt;=&lt;value&gt;,...</i>]<dd>Enables cpu, heap, or monitor profiling. This option is typically 
    followed by a list of comma-separated "&lt;suboption&gt;=&lt;value&gt" pairs
.
    Run the command <b>java&nbsp;-Xrunhprof:help</b> to obtain a 
    list of suboptions and their default values.

    <p>
    <dt><b>-Xrs</b>
    <dd>Reduces usage of operating-system signals by the Java virtual 
    machine (JVM).  This option is available beginning with J2SE 1.3.1.
    <p>
    In J2SE 1.3.0, the Shutdown Hooks facility was added to allow orderly
    shutdown of a Java application. The intent was to allow user cleanup
    code (such as closing database connections) to run at shutdown, even
    if the JVM terminates abruptly.
    <p>
    The JVM watches for console control events to implement shutdown hooks 
    for abnormal JVM termination. Specifically, the JVM registers a 
    console control handler which begins shutdown-hook processing and 
    returns TRUE for CTRL_C_EVENT, CTRL_CLOSE_EVENT, CTRL_LOGOFF_EVENT, and
    CTRL_SHUTDOWN_EVENT.
    <p>
    The JVM uses a similar mechanism to implement the pre-1.2 feature 
    of dumping thread stacks for debugging purposes. Sun's JVM uses 
    CTRL_BREAK_EVENT to perform thread dumps.
    <p>
    If the JVM is run as
    a service (for example, the servlet engine for a web server), it can
    receive CTRL_LOGOFF_EVENT but should not initiate shutdown since the
    operating system will not actually terminate the process. To avoid 
    possible interference such as this, the <b>-Xrs</b> command-line 
    option has been added beginning with J2SE 1.3.1. When the  
    <b>-Xrs</b> option is used on Sun's JVM, the JVM does not install a 
    console control handler,
    implying that it does not watch for or process CTRL_C_EVENT,
    CTRL_CLOSE_EVENT, CTRL_LOGOFF_EVENT, or CTRL_SHUTDOWN_EVENT.
    <p>
    There are two consequences of specifying <b>-Xrs</b>:
    <ul>
    <li>Ctrl-Break thread dumps are not available.
    <li>User code is responsible for causing shutdown hooks to run, for
        example by calling System.exit() when the JVM is to be terminated.
    </ul>
    <dt><p><b>\WARNING:</b> Flags <tt>-Xdebug</tt> and <tt>-Xint</tt>
        are mutually exclusive.  No more than one of
        those options should be used on a <tt>java</tt> command line.
