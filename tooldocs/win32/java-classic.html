<h1>Non-Standard Options of the Classic VM</h1>
</center>
<blockquote>
The Java 2 Classic VM is included only in the Java 2 SDK.  It is 
not included in the Java 2 Runtime Environment.
<dl>
    <dt><b>-Xbootclasspath:</b><i>bootclasspath</i>
	<dd>Specify a semicolon-separated list of directories, JAR
	archives, and ZIP archives to search for boot class files.
	These are used in place of the boot class files included in the
	Java 2 SDK. <em>Note: Applications that use this option for the 
        purpose of overriding a class in rt.jar should not be deployed 
        as doing so would contravene the Java 2 Runtime Environment 
        binary code license.</em>
    <p><dt><b>-Xbootclasspath/a:</b><i>path</i>
        <dd>Specify a semicolon-separated path of directires, JAR 
        archives, and ZIP archives to append to the default bootstrap 
        class path. 
    <p><dt><b>-Xbootclasspath/p:</b><i>path</i>
        <dd>Specify a semicolon-separated path of directires, JAR 
        archives, and ZIP archives to prepend in front of the default 
        bootstrap class path. <em>Note: Applications that use this option 
        for the purpose of overriding a class in rt.jar should not be 
        deployed as doing so would contravene the Java 2 Runtime Environment 
        binary code license.</em>
    <p>
    <dt><b>-Xdebug</b>
        <dd>Start with the debugger enabled.  The Java interpereter 
        prints out a password for jdb's use.  Refer to 
        <a href="jdb.html#description">jdb description</a> for more 
        details and an example.
    <p>
    <dt><b>-Xnoclassgc</b>
	<dd>Disable class garbage collection
    <p>
    <dt><b>-Xms</b><i>n</i>
	<dd>Specify the initial size of the memory allocation pool.
	This value must greather than 1000. To multiply the value by
	1000, append the letter <b>k</b>. To multiply the value by 1
	million, append the letter <b>m</b>. The default value is
	<b>1m</b>
    <p>
    <dt><b>-Xmx</b><i>n</i>
	<dd>Specify the maximum size of the memory allocation pool.
	This value must greather than 1000. To multiply the value by
	1000, append the letter <b>k</b>. To multiply the value by 1
	million, append the letter <b>m</b>. The default value is
	<b>64m</b>.
    <p>
    <dt><b>-Xrunhprof</b>[:<i>help</i>][:<i>&lt;suboption&gt;=&lt;value&gt;,...</i>]<dd>Enables cpu, heap, or monitor profiling. This option is typically 
    followed by a list of comma-separated "&lt;suboption&gt;=&lt;value&gt" pairs.
    Run the command <b>java&nbsp;-Xrunhprof:help</b> to obtain a 
    list of suboptions and their default values.

    <p>
    <dt><b>-Xrs</b>
	<dd>Reduce the use of operating system signals.
    <p>
    <dt><b>-Xcheck:jni</b>
	<dd>Perform additional checks for Java Native Interface
	functions.
    <p>
    <dt><b>-Xcheck:nabounds</b>
        <dd>Perform additional checks for Java Native Interface array bounds.
    <p>
    <dt><b>-Xfuture</b>
        <dd>Perform strict class-file format checks. For purposes of backwards 
        compatibility, the default format checks performed by the 
        Java 2 SDK's virtual machine are no stricter than 
        the checks performed by 1.1.x versions of the JDK software. The 
        <b>-Xfuture</b> flag turns on stricter class-file format checks 
        that enforce closer conformance to the class-file format 
        specification. Developers are encouraged to use this flag 
        when developing new code because the stricter checks will 
        become the default in future releases of the Java application 
        launcher.
