<blockquote>

<p>The policy for a Java runtime, specifying which 
<a href = "#Permissions">permissions</a> 
are available for code from various sources, is represented 
by a Policy object. The default Policy implementation obtains its
information from static ASCII policy configuration files.

<p>A policy file can be composed via a simple text editor, or via the 
graphical <b>Policy Tool </b> utility described in this document.
Using the <b>Policy Tool </b> saves typing and eliminates the need
for you to know the required syntax of policy files, thus
reducing errors.

<p>The <a href = "#Overview">Permissions and Policy Files Overview</a>
section of this document describes what permissions are,
and provides information about policy file contents and default
policy files. It also supplies links to more detailed discussions of
these topics.

<p>The <a href = "#Usage">Policy Tool Usage</a>
section describes how to use the
<b>Policy Tool</b> to create and modify policy files.

<p>The <a href = "#Examples">Examples</a>
section provides detailed examples of the use of <b>Policy Tool</b>.

<p>The <a href = "#SeeAlso">See Also</a>
section provides links to related documentation.

<H2><a name="Overview">Permissions and Policy Files Overview</a></H2>

<blockquote>

This section briefly describes what permissions are,
and provides information about policy file contents and default
policy files.

<H3><a name="Permissions">Permissions</a></H3>

<blockquote>

<p>A permission represents access to a system resource.
In order for a resource access to be allowed for an applet
(or an application running with a security manager),
the corresponding permission must be explicitly granted to
the code attempting the access.

<p>A permission typically has a name (often referred to as a
"target name") and, in some cases, a comma-separated list of
one or more actions. For example, to
create a permission to read the file named "abc" in the
<code>D:\tmp\</code> directory, you'd create a File Permission (technically, a
java.io.FilePermission permission) with target name
"D:\tmp\abc" and action string "read".

<p>In the default Policy implementation, code trying to
read the file must be granted the specified permission by a "policy entry" 
(sometimes referred to as a "grant entry") in a policy
configuration file. The <b>Policy Tool</b> can be used to create such
an entry in such a file.

<p>The <a href="../../guide/security/permissions.html">Permissions</a>
document contains tables that describe the built-in
permission types and that discuss the risks of granting each 
permission. It also contains tables showing the methods that
require permissions to be in effect in order to be successful,
and for each lists the required permission.

</blockquote>



<H3><a name="DefaultFiles">Default Policy Files and Their Locations</a></H3>

<blockquote>

<p>There is by default a single system-wide policy file, and an optional
user policy file.

<p>The system policy file is by default located at

<pre>
    <i>java.home</i>\lib\security\java.policy
</pre>

<p>Here, <i>java.home</i> is 
the runtime environment's directory (the <tt>jre</tt> directory in 
the SDK or the top-level directory of the Java 2 Runtime Environment).

<p>The user policy file is by default located at

<pre>
    <i>user.home</i>\.java.policy
</pre>

<p>Here, <i>user.home</i> indicates the 
user's <a href = "#HomeDirNote">home directory</a>.

<p>When the Policy is initialized, the system policy is loaded in first, and 
then the user policy is added to it. If neither policy is present, a built-in 
policy is used.  This built-in policy is the same as the original sandbox policy.

<p>Policy file locations are specified in the security properties file, which is 
located at

<pre>
    <i>java.home</i>\lib\security\java.security
</pre>

The policy file locations are specified as the values of properties whose names 
are of the form

<pre>
    policy.url.<i>n</i>
</pre>

Here, <code><i>n</i></code> indicates a number. You specify each such property 
value in a line of the following form:

<blockquote>
<pre>
policy.url.<i>n</i>=<i>URL</i>
</pre>
</blockquote>

Here, <i>URL</i> is a URL specification.
For example, the default policy files, sometimes referred to as
the "system" and "user" policy files, respectively,
are defined in the security properties file as

<blockquote>
<pre>
policy.url.1=file:${java.home}/lib/security/java.policy
policy.url.2=file:${user.home}/.java.policy
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Note: when a string like

<pre>
    ${some.property}
</pre>

appears in a policy file, or in the security properties file, it will be expanded 
to the value of the specified system property. For example,

<pre>
    ${java.home}
</pre>

indicates the value of the <i>java.home</i> property specifying the runtime environment's directory (the <tt>jre</tt> directory in 
the SDK or the top-level directory of the Java 2 Runtime Environment).

<p>Whether or not property expansion is allowed is controlled by the value 
of the  "policy.expandProperties" property in the security properties 
file. If the value of this property is true (the default), expansion is 
allowed.

<p>You can actually specify a number of URLs in the security properties
file (including ones of the form "http://"), 
and all the designated policy files will get loaded. You can also comment out or
change the second one to disable reading the default user policy file.

<p>The algorithm starts at policy.url.1, and keeps incrementing until it does not 
find a URL. Thus if you have policy.url.1 and policy.url.3, policy.url.3 will 
never be read.

<p>It is also possible to specify an additional or a different policy file when 
invoking execution of an application. This can be done via the 
"-Djava.security.policy" command-line argument, which sets the value of 
the <i>java.security.policy</i> property. For example, if you 
type the following, where <i>pURL</i> is a URL indicating
the location of a policy file, then the 
specified policy file will be loaded in addition to all the policy files 
that are specified in the security properties file. 

<pre>
  java -Djava.security.manager -Djava.security.policy=pURL SomeApp
</pre>

(The 
"-Djava.security.manager" argument ensures that the default security 
manager is installed, and thus the application is subject to policy checks.
It is not required if the application <i>SomeApp</i> installs a security manager.)

<p>If you instead type the following, using a double equals, then
just the specified policy file will be used; all others will be ignored.

<pre>
  java -Djava.security.manager -Djava.security.policy==pURL SomeApp
</pre>

<p>If you want to pass a policy file to the appletviewer, again use a 
"-Djava.security.policy" argument as follows:

<pre>
  appletviewer -J-Djava.security.policy=pURL  myApplet
</pre>

Please note: The "-Djava.security.policy" policy file value will be ignored 
(for both java and appletviewer commands) if the "policy.allowSystemProperty" 
property in the security properties file is set to false. The default is true.

</blockquote>


<H3><a name="FileContents">Policy File Contents</a></H3>

<blockquote>

A policy configuration file (policy file, for short) indicates
what permissions are allowed for code from specified code sources.

<p>A policy configuration file contains a list of entries.
It may contain a single "keystore" entry, and contains zero or more "policy" 
(or "grant") entries.

<p>A <i>keystore</i> is a database of private keys and their associated digital 
certificates such as X.509 certificate chains authenticating the 
corresponding public keys. The <a href="keytool.html"><b>keytool</b></a>
utility is used to create and administer keystores. The keystore 
specified in a policy configuration 
file is used to look up the public keys of the signers (if any) specified in the 
grant entries of the file. Public keys are used to verify the digital
signatures used to sign the code.

<p>A keystore entry must appear in a policy 
configuration file if any policy entries specify signer aliases.

<p>At this time, there can be only one keystore entry in the policy file.
The keystore entry specifies the URL location of the keystore and 
optionally the keystore type. 
The URL is relative to the policy file location. Thus if the policy 
file is specified in the security properties file as:

<pre>
  policy.url.1=http://foo.bar.com/blah/some.policy
</pre>

and that policy file has a keystore entry with value ".keystore"
then the keystore will be loaded from:

<pre>
  http://foo.bar.com/blah/.keystore
</pre>

The URL can also be absolute.

<p>A keystore type defines the storage and data format of the keystore
information, and the algorithms used to
protect private keys in the keystore and the integrity of the keystore
itself. If you don't specify a type, it is assumed to be that
specified by the "keystore.type" property value in the security
properties file. The value is initially  "JKS", specifying 
a proprietary keystore type 
supported by Sun Microsystems. 

<p>Code being executed is always considered to come from a particular
"code source". The code source may include not only the CodeBase 
location (URL) where the applet (or application) originated from, 
but also a reference to one or more (symbolic) alias
names from a keystore specifying the keystore entries containing
the public key(s) corresponding to the private key(s) used to sign 
the code.

<p>Each policy entry in the policy file contains the following:

<ul>

<li>an optional <b>CodeBase</b> entry specifying the URL location where the code 
originates from,<p>

<li>an optional <b>SignedBy</b> entry specifying the alias name from the
keystore used to reference the signer whose private key was used to 
sign the code, and<p>

<li>one or more <b>permission</b> entries specifying which permissions
are granted to code from the specified CodeBase and signed
by the specified SignedBy alias.

</ul>

<p>


<H2><a name="Usage">Policy Tool Usage</a></H2>

<blockquote>


<H3><a name="StartTool">Starting Policy Tool</a></H3>

<blockquote>

To start <b>Policy Tool</b>, simply type the following
at the command line. 

<pre>
  policytool
</pre>

<p>This brings up the "Policy Tool" window. 

<p>Whenever Policy Tool
is started, it tries to
fill in this window with policy information from what is sometimes referred to
as the "user policy file". 
The user policy file is by default a file named <code>.java.policy</code> in your
<a href = "#HomeDirNote">home directory</a>. 
If Policy Tool cannot find the user policy file, it reports
the situation and displays a blank "Policy Tool" window
(that is, a window with headings and buttons but no data in it):

<p>
<center><IMG SRC="images/ptBlank.gif" ALT="Blank Policy Tool window">
</center>

<p>You can then proceed to either 
<a href = "#Open">open</a> whatever policy file you want to work on
or create a new policy file, by 
<a href = "#AddEntry">adding policy entries</a>, optionally
<a href = "#SpecifyKeystore">specifying a keystore</a>, and 
<a href = "#SaveFile">saving the file</a>).

<p>The first time you run the <b>Policy Tool</b>, there will not be a
user policy file (unless you created one manually). 

</blockquote>


<H3><a name="Create">Creating a new Policy File</a></H3>

<blockquote>

To create a new policy file, start by simply selecting the <b>New</b> command
from the <b>File</b> menu. This will close the currently open policy 
file (if any, after first prompting you to save it if needed) and bring
up a new policy tool window, that is, a window with headings
and buttons but no data in it.

<p>Please Note: this is not necessary the first time
you run the Policy Tool. Since the tool tries to open the user policy
file and one doesn't exist yet (unless it was created manually),
the tool will bring up a window without any data in it.

<p>Once you have a new policy tool window, you can then 
<a href = "#AddEntry">create the policy entries</a>,
and <a href = "#SpecifyKeystore">specify the keystore</a> (if any of
the policy entries specify a keystore alias).
At any point, you can <a href = "#SaveFile">save the policy file</a>.

</blockquote>


<H3><a name="Open">Opening a Different Policy File</a></H3>

<blockquote>

To work on a different policy file than the one currently being
worked on (if any), use the <b>Open</b> command in the
<b>File</b> menu. 

<p>This will close the currently open policy 
file (if any, after first prompting you to save it if needed) and 
will present you with an Open dialog, which you can use
to navigate the directory structure until you get to the
directory containing the policy file you want to work on.
Select that file, then select the <b>Open</b> button.

<p>The "Policy Tool" window will then be filled in with information
from the policy file, including the policy file name,
the keystore URL (if any), and the CodeBase and SignedBy parts
of each policy entry in the policy file.

</blockquote>


<H3><a name="SpecifyKeystore">Specifying the Keystore</a></H3>

<blockquote>

To specify the keystore containing the key information for
the aliases specified in the SignedBy parts of policy entries,
select the <b>Change Keystore</b> command in the 
<b>Edit</b> menu.

<p>This brings up a dialog box in which you specify the new
keystore URL and optionally the keystore type.

<p>As an example, to specify the keystore named "mykeystore" in the
<code>Tests</code> directory on the <code>D:</code> drive, type the following 
<code>file:</code> URL into the text box labeled "New KeyStore URL".

<pre>
  file:/D:/Tests/mykeystore
</pre>

To also specify that the keystore type is "JKS" (the proprietary
keystore type supported by Sun Microsystems), type
the following into the text box labeled "New KeyStore Type".

<pre>
  JKS
</pre>

<p>Note: the "New KeyStore URL" value is a URL and thus should always utilize 
slashes (never backslashes) as the directory separator, even when 
the keystore is actually on a Windows system.

<p>When you are done specifying the keystore URL and 
type (if any), select <b>OK</b>
(or you can select <b>Cancel</b> to cancel the operation).
If you didn't cancel, the text box labeled "Keystore:" is now 
filled in with the keystore URL and type.

</blockquote>


<H3><a name="AddEntry">Adding a New Policy Entry</a></H3>

<blockquote>

To add a new policy entry, select the <b>Add Policy Entry</b> button
in the main "Policy Tool" window.

<p>This brings up a "Policy Entry" dialog box:

<p>
<center><IMG SRC="images/AddEntryBlank.gif" ALT="Blank Add Entry Dialog">
</center>

<p>Using this dialog box, you specify 

<ul>

<li>an optional <b>CodeBase</b> entry indicating the URL location where the code 
originates from. For example, to indicate code from the local <code>JavaSoft\TESTS\</code>
directory on the <code>D:</code> drive, type the following file URL into the <b>CodeBase</b> 
text box:

<pre>
  file:/D:/JavaSoft/TESTS/
</pre>

<p>Note: a <b>CodeBase</b> value contains a URL and thus should always utilize 
slashes (never backslashes) as the directory separator, even when 
the code source is actually on a Windows system.

<p>

<li>an optional <b>SignedBy</b> entry indicating the alias name from the
keystore used to reference the signer whose private key was used to 
sign the code. For example, to indicate the alias named "duke",
simply type the following into the <b>SignedBy</b> text box:

<pre>
  duke
</pre>

<p>

<li>one or more <b>permission</b> entries indicating which permissions
are granted to the code from the source indicated by the 
CodeBase and SignedBy values (or to any code if no such values
are specified). See <a href = "#AddPerm">Adding a New Permission</a>.

</ul>

<p>The <b>SignedBy</b> value is a string alias that is mapped (using the
keystore) to a set of public keys that are associated with the signers.  
These keys are used to verify that classes from the specified code source
are really signed by these signers.

<p>The <b>SignedBy</b> value can be a comma-separated string containing 
names of multiple signers, an example of which is "Adam,Eve,Charles", which 
means "signed by Adam and Eve and Charles" (i.e., the relationship is AND, 
not OR). 

<p>The <b>SignedBy</b> value is optional in that, if it is omitted, 
it signifies "any signer," or in other words, it doesn't matter whether 
the code is signed or not.
Similarly, if there is no <b>CodeBase</b> entry, then it 
signifies "any code"; it doesn't matter where 
the code originates from.

<p>Thus, if there is no <b>CodeBase</b> entry, then all code signed
by the specified alias(es) will be granted the specified permissions.
If there is no <b>SignedBy</b> entry, then all code from
the specified <b>CodeBase</b> will be granted the specified permissions,
regardless of whether the code is signed or not, and by whom.
If there is no <b>CodeBase</b> entry, and also no 
<b>SignedBy</b> entry, then all code will be granted the specified permissions.

<p>Note: The exact meaning of a <b>CodeBase</b> value depends on the
characters at the end. A <b>CodeBase</b> with a trailing "/"
matches all class files (not JAR files) in the specified directory.
A <b>CodeBase</b> with a trailing "/*" matches 
all files (both class and JAR files) contained in that directory.
A <b>CodeBase</b> with a trailing "/-" matches 
all files (both class and JAR files) in the directory and 
recursively all files in subdirectories contained in that directory.


<H4><a name="AddPerm">Adding a New Permission</a></H4>

<blockquote>

To add a new permission, select the <b>Add Permission</b> button
in the "Policy Entry" dialog box.
This brings up the "Permissions" dialog box:

<p>
<center><IMG SRC="images/AddPermBlank.gif" ALT="Blank Add Permissions Dialog">
</center>

<p>To add the permission:

<ol>

<li>Type or select a <b>permission type</b>. 

<p>The drop-down list 
labeled "Permission:" contains a list of built-in permission
types. If you want such a type, select it from the list, and the
complete permission type name appears in the text box to the
right of the drop-down list.

<p>If you instead want to specify a permission type defined by you
or others, type the permission type into the text box.
<p>

<li>Type or select a permission <b>target name</b>. 

<p>If you selected a built-in permission from the "Permission:"
drop-down list, and permissions of that type have specific
target name values, then the drop-down list 
labeled "Target Name:" contains a list of those values, from
which you can choose.

<p>In some cases, where the target name
possibilities are infinite but there are some built-in target name
specifications that have special meaning, such target names will
appear in the drop-down list. For example, the special target name
of "&lt;&lt;All Files&gt;&gt;" will appear in the list for File Permissions.

<p>To specify a target name not available in the drop-down list,
type the target name directly into the text box to the
right of the "Target Name:" drop-down list. For example, to specify 
the file named <code>data</code> in the <code>JavaSoft\ptTest\</code> 
directory on the <code>D:</code> drive, type

<pre>
  D:\JavaSoft\ptTest\data
</pre>

<p>

<li>Type or select one or more <b>actions</b>, if actions are relevant.

<p>Some permissions just have a target name, but no actions. For such
permissions, leave the text box to the right of the "Actions:" drop-down list
blank. (It will automatically be darkened and unavailable for this type of built-in
permission.)

<p>For permissions requiring action specifications, type the comma-separated
list of actions into the text box, or select them from the drop-down list.
For example, to specify both read and write access to a file specified for a
File Permission, first select <code>read</code> (or <code>write</code>, 
order doesn't matter)
from the list. The word "read" appears in the text box. Then select 
<code>write</code>, and the word "write" will be appended,
preceded by a comma and a space.

<p>

<li>Type a <b>SignedBy</b> alias into the text box to the right of the
"Signed By" label, if required.
The <b>SignedBy</b> value for a permission entry 
is optional. If present, it indicates a signed permission. That is,
the permission class itself must be signed by the given alias(es) in
order for the permission to be granted.


</ol>

When you are done specifying the permission information, select the
<b>OK</b> button (or <b>Cancel</b> to cancel). The new permission appears in a line
in the "Policy Entry" dialog.

<p>You can then add additional permissions by following the same sequence
of steps. Or you can <a href = "#EditPerm">edit</a> an existing permission 
or <a href = "#RemovePerm">remove</a> a permission.

</blockquote>


<H4><a name="EditPerm">Editing a Permission</a></H4>

<blockquote>

To edit an existing permission, select the line for that permission in the
"Policy Entry" dialog box, then select the <b>Edit Permission</b> button.
Alternatively, you can simply double-click the line for that permission.

<p>This brings up the same type of "Permissions" dialog box as appears
when you are <a href = "#AddPerm">adding</a> a new permission, except 
in this case the dialog box
is filled in with the existing permission information. To change the
information, either make new selections from the drop-down lists or
replace the information in the text boxes.

<p>When you are done, select the
<b>OK</b> button (or <b>Cancel</b> to cancel changes). 
The "Policy Entry" dialog now shows the permission with any modifications
you made.

</blockquote>


<H4><a name="RemovePerm">Removing a Permission</a></H4>

<blockquote>

To remove an existing permission, select the line for that permission in the
"Policy Entry" dialog box, then select the <b>Remove Permission</b> button.

</blockquote>


<H4><a name="EntryDone">Completing the Addition of a Policy Entry</a></H4>

<blockquote>

Once you are done adding a policy entry, select the <b>Done</b> button
in the "Policy Entry" dialog, or <b>Cancel</b> to cancel.

<p>If you selected <b>Done</b>, the "Policy Tool" window now contains a line
representing the policy entry. The line just contains the CodeBase and SignedBy
information (if any). If neither was specified in the "Policy Entry"
dialog, just

<pre>
  CodeBase &lt;ALL&gt;
</pre>

appears.

<p>Note: a warning is displayed upon closing the policy entry if 
it contains any <b>SignedBy</b> 
aliases that don't yet exist in your keystore. Select <b>OK</b> and 
make a note to create such
an alias, or <a href = "#EditEntry">edit the policy entry</a> to fix 
the alias if was wrong.

<H3><a name="EditEntry">Editing a Policy Entry</H3>

<blockquote>

To edit an existing policy entry, select the line for that entry in the main
"Policy Tool" window, then select the <b>Edit Policy Entry</b> button.
Alternatively, you can simply double-click the line for that entry.

<p>This brings up the same type of "Policy Entry" dialog box as appears

<ul>

<li>a single backslash, as in <code>D:\Temp\data</code>

<li>a double backslash, as in <code>D:\\Temp\\data</code>

<li>a slash, as in <code>D:/Temp/data</code>

</ul>

Single backslashes are the "normal" Windows directory separators,
and slashes are also accepted.

<p>However, policy files themselves cannot contain single
backslashes. When a policy file is read, the strings are processed by 
a tokenizer, which allows "\" to be used as an escape string 
(e.g., "\n" to indicate a new line)
and which thus requires two backslashes to indicate a single backslash.

<p>If you use single backslashes as your separators, <b>Policy Tool</b>
automatically converts them to double backslashes (e.g., after you
select <b>OK</b> in the Permissions dialog box), for your convenience.

<H3><a name="HomeDirNote">Note Regarding Windows "Home" Directories</a></H3>

<blockquote>

The user policy file is by default the file named <code>.java.policy</code>
in your "home directory," as determined by the 
<i>user.home</i> system property value. 
Given user name <i>uName</i>, the <i>user.home</i>
property value defaults to

<pre>
  C:\Winnt\Profiles\uName on multi-user Windows NT systems
  C:\Windows\Profiles\uName on multi-user Windows 95 systems
  C:\Windows on single-user Windows 95 systems
</pre>

Thus, if the user name is "cathy", <i>user.home</i> defaults to

<pre>
  C:\Winnt\Profiles\cathy on multi-user Windows NT systems
  C:\Windows\Profiles\cathy on multi-user Windows 95 systems
  C:\Windows on single-user Windows 95 systems
</pre>

<H3><a name="ExStartingCreation">Starting Creation of the User Policy File</a></H3>

<blockquote>

<p>Initially, there is no
user policy file (unless you created one manually). So to create the
user policy file, first simply start <b>Policy Tool</b> by typing 
the following at the command line. 

<pre>
  policytool
</pre>

<p>This brings up the "Policy Tool" window. 

<p>Whenever Policy Tool
is started, it tries to
fill in this window with policy information from what is sometimes referred to
as the "user policy file". 
The user policy file is by default a file named <code>.java.policy</code> in your
<a href = "#HomeDirNote">home directory</a>. 
If Policy Tool cannot find the user policy file, it reports
the situation and displays a blank "Policy Tool" window
(that is, a window with headings and buttons but no data in it):

<p>
<center><IMG SRC="images/ptBlank.gif" ALT="Blank Policy Tool window">
</center>

<p>You can now create the user policy file by adding entries and saving
the file.

<H3><a name="ExAddEntry">Adding a Policy Entry</a></H3>

<blockquote>

Suppose you want to grant all classes from the <code>Tests\</code> directory on 
the <code>D:</code> drive permission to read the file named <code>mydata</code> in the 
<code>D:\Temp\data\</code> directory.
To do so, first select the <b>Add Policy Entry</b> button
in the main "Policy Tool" window.

<p>This brings up a "Policy Entry" dialog box:

<p>
<center><IMG SRC="images/AddEntryBlank.gif" ALT="Blank Add Entry Dialog">
</center>

<p>Using this dialog box, type the file URL

<pre>
  file:/D:/Tests/
</pre>

into the <b>CodeBase</b> text box. (Note, this is a URL and thus must always have
slashes, not backslashes.)

<p>Leave the <b>SignedBy</b> text box blank, since you aren't requiring the code
to be signed.

<p>To add the permission, select the <b>Add Permission</b> button.
This brings up the "Permissions" dialog box:

<p>
<center><IMG SRC="images/AddPermBlank.gif" ALT="Blank Add Permissions Dialog">
</center>

<p>To add the permission:

<ol>

<li>Select "File Permission" from the "Permission:" drop-down list. The
complete permission type name (java.io.FilePermission) now appears in the 
text box to the right of the drop-down list.<p>

<li>Type the following in the text box to the right of the list labeled
"Target Name:":

<pre>
  D:\Temp\data\mydata
</pre>

<li>Specify read access by selecting "read" from the 
"Actions:" drop-down list.

</ol>

Now the "Permission" dialog box looks like the following:

<p>
<center><IMG SRC="images/AddFilePerm1.gif" ALT="First File Permission">
</center>

<p>When you are done specifying the permission information, select the
<b>OK</b> button. The new permission appears in a line
in the "Policy Entry" dialog.

<p>
<center><IMG SRC="images/AddEntry1.gif" ALT="First Policy Entry">
</center>

<p>Note: Each backslash in the file path you typed has been replaced
with two backslashes, as described in 
<a href = "#FileSpecNote">Note Regarding File Specifications</a>. 

<p>You are now done specifying this policy entry, so select the <b>Done</b> 
button. The "Policy Tool" window now contains a line
representing the policy entry. The line just contains the CodeBase value:

<p>
<center><IMG SRC="images/ptOneCB.gif" ALT="Policy Tool with one CodeBase">

<H3><a name = "ExSpecifyKeystore">Specifying a Keystore</a></H3>

<blockquote>

Suppose you also want to grant any code from the URL
"http://java.sun.com/" and 
signed by the alias "duke"
read access to all files in the <code>D:\tmp\</code> directory.
Suppose you also want to give such code permission
to initiate outgoing socket connections to any hosts. 
You need to do two things:

<ol>

<li>Specify the keystore containing the alias, and<p>

<li><a href = "#ExAddSignedByEntry">Create the policy entry</a> 
granting the permissions.

</ol>

To specify the keystore containing the key information for
the aliases specified in any <b>SignedBy</b> parts of policy entries,
select the <b>Change Keystore</b> command in the 
<b>Edit</b> menu of the main "Policy Tool" window.

<p>This brings up a dialog box in which you specify the new
keystore URL and optionally the keystore type.

<p>As an example, to specify the keystore named "mykeystore" in the
<code>Tests</code> directory on the <code>D:</code> drive, type the following 
<code>file:</code> URL into the text box labeled "New KeyStore URL":

<pre>
  file:/D:/Tests/mykeystore
</pre>

If the keystore type is the default type, as specified by the
"keystore.type" property value in the security properties
file, you don't need to type a "New KeyStore Type" value.
The default value of that property is "JKS" 
(the proprietary keystore type supported by Sun Microsystems).

<p>To specify the keystore type, type its value 
into the text box labeled "New KeyStore Type."
For example, to indicate that the keystore type is "JKS" 
type

<pre>
  JKS
</pre>

The result is:
<p>
<center><IMG SRC="images/AddKeystore.gif" ALT="Keystore">
</center>

<p>Note: the "New KeyStore URL" value is a URL and thus should always utilize 
slashes (never backslashes) as the directory separator, even when 
the keystore is actually on a Windows system. 

<p>When you are done specifying the keystore URL and type, select <b>OK</b>.
The text box labeled "Keystore:" is now 
filled in with the URL and type.
 
<p>Next, you need to specify the policy entry:

<H3><a name="ExAddSignedByEntry">Adding a Policy Entry with a SignedBy alias</a></H3>

<blockquote>

Select the <b>Add Policy Entry</b> button
in the main "Policy Tool" window.
This brings up the "Policy Entry" dialog box.
Type the following
into the the <b>CodeBase</b> text box:

<pre>
  http://java.sun.com/*
</pre>

The "*" indicates that both class and JAR files in the specified directory
are to be considered to match this <b>CodeBase</b>.

<p>Now, type the following alias into the <b>SignedBy</b> text box:

<pre>
  duke
</pre>

<p>To add the first permission, select the <b>Add Permission</b> button.
This brings up the "Permissions" dialog box. Do the following

<ol>

<li>Select "File Permission" from the "Permission:" drop-down list. The
complete permission type name (java.io.FilePermission) now appears in the 
text box to the right of the drop-down list.<p>

<li>Type the following in the text box to the right of the list labeled
"Target Name:" to specify all files in the <code>D:\tmp\</code> directory:

<pre>
  D:\tmp\*
</pre>

<li>Specify read access by selecting "read" from the 
"Actions:" drop-down list.

</ol>

Now the "Permissions" dialog box looks like the following:

<p>
<center><IMG SRC="images/AddFilePerm2.gif" ALT="Second File Permission">
</center>

<p>Select the
<b>OK</b> button. The new permission appears in a line
in the "Policy Entry" dialog.

<p>Now you need to add the other permission. Select the <b>Add Permission</b> button.
In the "Permissions" dialog box, do the following

<ol>

<li>Select "Socket Permission" from the "Permission:" drop-down list. The
complete permission type name (java.net.SocketPermission) now appears in the 
text box to the right of the drop-down list.<p>

<li>Type the following in the text box to the right of the list labeled
"Target Name:" to specify all hosts:

<pre>
  *
</pre>

<li>Specify permission to make connections by selecting "connect" from the 
"Actions:" drop-down list.

</ol>

Now the "Permissions" dialog box looks like the following:

<p>
<center><IMG SRC="images/AddSocketPerm.gif" ALT="Socket Permission">
