<h3>Introduction</h3>
</a>

<blockquote>

<p>
This document summarizes a few important changes in command line options
between JDK1.1 and Java 2 SDK tools.  Its target audience is those already 
familiar with the command line options of JDK1.1 tools.

<p>
Please note that every effort has been made to keep the options in Java 2 SDK
backwards compatible with the options in JDK1.1, where possible.  The purpose
of this document is to provide you with a quick overview of what has changed,
and to outline the motivation behind the changes.  We hope that understanding
our motivations will help you better use the new features.

<p>
Throughout this document we use the term "Java platform classes"
to refer to classes that belong to the Java platform, as specified
in the <a href="../../api/">Java API Specification</a>, 
such as <codej>ava.lang.String</code>.  These reside in 
<code>classes.zip</code> or <code>rt.jar</code>.  We also use
the term "class path" to refer to the search path set by 
<code>CLASSPATH</code> and <code>-classpath</code>. 

<p>
Although the examples in this document are Solaris oriented, they apply
equally to Windows, after the slashes and prompts have been appropriately
changed.

<a name="clspath">
<h3>Changes to <code>CLASSPATH</code> and <code>-classpath</code></h3>
</a>

<blockquote>

<p>
The class path has a default value and can be set by <code>-classpath</code> 
or <code>CLASSPATH</code>.  In 1.1, it worked as follows:
<ul>

<li> <b>Class path default</b> - The default value of the class path was (1) the path where Java
platform classes resided (<code>classes.zip</code> or 
<code>rt.jar</code>), and (2) the current working directory (".", 
read as "dot").

<li> <b><code>CLASSPATH</code></B> - If the environment variable <code>CLASSPATH</code> was set, then
the class path would (1) continue to contain <code>classes.zip</code> or
<code>rt.jar</code> just the like default plus (2) the newly set
value instead of the current working directory.  [See Note 1]

<li> <b><code>-classpath</code></b> - If the option <code>-classpath &lt;path&gt;</code> was used, then
<code>&lt;path&gt;</code> had to explicitly contain both (1)
<code>classes.zip</code> or <code>rt.jar</code> <i>and</i> 
(2) application classes.

</ul>

This behavior for <code>-classpath</code> was unfortunate because
it meant users had to spell out the path to <code>classes.zip</code>:

<pre>
 % java -classpath /sdk-path/lib/classes.zip:/app/classes Application
</pre>

We say unfortunate because this is inherently error-prone; the onus is
on the user to ensure that the <code>java</code> command and the
<code>classes.zip</code> were from the same JDK version.  We ourselves
have spent time debugging problems where a 1.1.4 <code>java</code> was
trying to run 1.1.3 <code>classes.zip</code>, and this does not work
because the native methods do not match.

<p>
The good news is that the <code>-classpath</code> option as used by 
the Java 2 SDK tools 
has taken on the same meaning as the <code>CLASSPATH</code> 
environment variable in the Java 2 SDK, so you can now conveniently omit 
having to spell out the path to Java platform classes:

<pre>
 % java -classpath /app/classes Application
</pre>

<p>
Some developers like to temporarily modify individual Java platform classes 
such as <code>java/util/Vector.class</code>, for purposes such as 
adding <code>println</code> statements to understand how the class 
works.  In the Java 2 Platform, these users would not be able to use the <code>-classpath</code> 
option to set the path to Java platform classes, as was possible in 1.1.  
For such uses, the <a href="#bootcp"><code>-Xbootclasspath</code></a> 
option must be used in the Java 2 SDK.

<p>
<b>Note 1</b> - Contrary to the bulleted statement above, we have seen
users explicitly placing the path to <code>classes.zip</code> in their
<code>CLASSPATH</code> environment variable, though this was not at
all required.

</blockquote>

<a name="searchpaths">
<h3>New Class Search Paths</h3>
</a>

<blockquote>

<p>
The <a href="#clspath">earlier section</a> showed that in JDK1.1,
there was <i>one</i> search path used to find classes; its value could
be set either through the <code>-classpath</code> option or the
<code>CLASSPATH</code> environment variable.

<p>
In the Java 2 SDK, there are <i>three</i> search paths that are used to find
classes:

<ol>

<li> The first place where <code>java</code> looks for classes is the
<b><i>bootstrap classpath</i></b>.  The value of this path can be
examined by calling
<code>System.getProperty("sun.boot.class.path")</code>.  Note that the
prefix "<code>sun.</code>" shows that, at least for now, this property
is specific to Sun's implementation.

<li> The second place where <code>java</code> looks for classes is the
<b><i>extension directories</i></b>.  The list of directories can be
examined by calling <code>System.getProperty("java.ext.dirs")</code>.

<li> The third and last place where <code>java</code> looks for
classes is the <b><i>application classpath</i></b>.  The value of this
path can be examined by calling
<code>System.getProperty("java.class.path")</code>.

</ol>

<p>
For a discussion of the new "extension directories" feature 
mentioned in item 2, refer to 
<a href="javac.html#crosscomp-options">javac</a> and
<a href="../../guide/extensions/index.html">The
Extensions Framework</a> documentation.

<p>
In the Java 2 SDK, the argument you specify with the
<code>-classpath</code> option is the value of the <i>application
classpath</i>; it should contain the path to classes that constitute
your application.  The <i>bootstrap classpath</i> contains the path to
Java platform classes that are contained in a file named 
<code>rt.jar</code>.  This is discussed in the next section.

</blockquote>

<a name="bootcp">
<h3>New Options to Search for Boot Classes: 
<code>-Xbootclasspath</code>, <code>-bootclasspath</code></h3>
</a>

<blockquote>

<blockquote>
NOTE - For a description of what the leading "X" means
in an option, see <a href="#nonstd">Standard vs. Non-standard
Options</a>.
</blockquote>

<b><code>-Xbootclasspath</code></b> - 
As mentioned, the <i>bootstrap classpath</i> contains the path to
Java platform classes that are contained in <code>rt.jar</code>.  
If you need to override the location where Java platform classes 
are found, you must use the
<a href="java.html#nonstandard"><code>-Xbootclasspath</code></a> 
option -- this is a big change from 1.1 where <code>-classpath</code> 
provided this functionality.  Consider this example:

<pre>
 % java -Xbootclasspath:/my/bootclasses:/jre/lib/rt.jar MyApplication 
</pre>

<p>
In this example, the <code>java</code> command searches
the paths provided by <code>-Xbootclasspath</code> 
to find the Java platform classes.
It first searches the directory <code>/my/bootclasses</code>
before searching through <code>rt.jar</code>.  If you wanted 
to add debugging statements to <code>java/util/Vector.class</code>, 
you would place the modified class file under
<code>/my/bootclasses</code>.  This modified version would be 
found first, the search would then stop and this version would 
be loaded.

<p>
<b><code>-bootclasspath</code></b> - 
In addition, <code>javac</code> supports a similar option
<a href="javac.html#crosscomp-options"><code>-bootclasspath</code></a> 
which can be used to change the platform classes you are 
compiling against.  This is most useful if you need to
take advantage of the bug fixes in the Java 2 SDK's javac to compile a 1.1
application.  Please refer to that option for detailed 
instructions on how to do this.

<p>
Here are some relevant notes for both options:

  <ul>

  <li><b>Avoid overriding Java platform classes</b> - 
  The Java 2 Runtime Environment re-distribution license does not allow replacing parts
  of <code>rt.jar</code>.  So the <code>-Xbootclasspath</code> option
  may <i>not</i> be used override parts of <code>rt.jar</code> when
  you are re-distributing the Runtime Environment with an application.  When
  re-distributing, if there is a need to place your application on the
  bootclasspath, make sure that unmodified
  <code>rt.jar</code> and (the optional) <code>i18n.jar</code>, are
  placed first on -Xbootclasspath before your application classes.
  For example:

   <pre>
    <font color=red># If app needs to be deployed on -Xbootclasspath, then use: </font>
    % java -Xbootclasspath:/jre/lib/rt.jar:/app/classes Application

    <font color=red># instead of accidentally overriding rt.jar:</font>
    % java -Xbootclasspath:/app/classes:/jre/lib/rt.jar Application
   </pre>

  <a name="implsearch"></a>
  <li><b>Our implementation of class path searching</b> - 
  The discerning reader is bound to ask "How are all these paths
  tied together by the implementation of <code>java</code>?"  We'll
  resist the temptatation to say, "the answer is beyond the scope of
  this document," but instead present a short version of the story.

  <p>
  The Java 2 Platform introduced the notion of a <i>parent</i> classloader.  A
  well-behaved classloader in the Java 2 SDK always checks to see if its parent
  can load the class before it uses its own mechanisms (such as paths
  it might have been asked to look at) to locate a class. 

  <p>
  The Java runtime has three classloaders, where a 
  parent classloader is shown above its child:

<pre>
      bootstrap classloader
               |
      extension classloader
               |
     application classloader
</pre>

  The bootstrap classloader searches for classes only on the 
  bootclasspath and on no other path.  Likewise, the extension
  classloader searches in the extensions loaded from extdirs,
  and the application classloader searches only on the application
  class path.

  <p>
  Say, you launch your application with the following command line:

<pre>
   % java -classpath ~/classes MyApplication
</pre>

  This command causes a sequence of steps, giving each classloader
  in turn a chance to load the application classes.  First, the 
  <code>java</code> command asks the application classloader 
  (the one that uses the <code>-classpath</code> value) to load
  <code>MyApplication</code>.  However, rather than trying to load 
  this class, the application classloader asks its parent, the
  extension classloader, to load the class, which in turn, 
  likewise asks its parent, the bootstrap classloader, to load the
  class. The bootstrap classloader is built into the virtual machine 
  and has no parent; it attempts to load the class from the 
  bootstrap classpath.  Since the bootstrap classloader will not
  find <code>MyApplication</code> (we did not use 
  <code>-Xbootclasspath</code> to disturb the default path),
  it allows the extension classloader to try to load the class,
  which also will not find the class (since we did not use
  <code>-Djava.ext.dirs</code> options to disturb the default 
  path). Finally, the application classloader ends up finding
  and loading <code>~/classes/MyApplication.class</code>.

  <p>
  It is such parenting that produces the order "<i>bootstrap
  first, extensions next, applications last</i>" when searching for
  classes.  For more information we again refer you to the 
  <a href="../../guide/extensions/index.html">The
  Extensions Framework</a> documentation.

  </ul>

<a name="applets">
<h3>Appletviewer No Longer Uses <code>CLASSPATH</code></h3>
</a>

<blockquote>

<p>
In the Java 2 SDK, <code>appletviewer</code> ignores your
<code>CLASSPATH</code> environment setting (which it did not
ignore in 1.1).  Though this sounds like a
drastic change, this is the semantics you really want when testing 
your applets.

<p>
Let us consider an example that worked in JDK 1.1, but will not
work in the Java 2 SDK.  Say you placed your <code>.html</code> file in a
place different from your <code>.class</code> files.  In JDK 1.1, you
could set your <code>CLASSPATH</code> at the <code>.class</code>
files, and <code>appletviewer</code> would pick them up.

<pre>
   <font color=red># Foo.class and foo.html are in different directories.</font>
   % ls /home/user/htmls /home/user/classes 
   /home/user/classes:
   Foo.class
     
   /home/user/htmls:
   foo.html

   <font color=red># Foo.class is NOT in applet's codebase:</font>
   % cat /home/user/htmls/foo.html
   &lt;applet code=Foo height=100 width=100>&lt;/applet>

   <font color=red># Can an applet use a class outside its codebase?</font>
   % setenv CLASSPATH /home/user/classes

   <font color=red># Works in 1.1.</font>
   % appletviewer /home/user/htmls/foo.html

   <font color=red># ClassNotFoundException in the Java 2 SDK!</font>
   % appletviewer /home/user/htmls/foo.html
</pre>

<p>Why did we change what looks like reasonable behavior?  Look more
closely.  When an applet runs in a browser which does not honor
<code>CLASSPATH</code> the way SDK's <code>appletviewer</code> does,
you have the same problem that you have when using the Java 2 SDK.  
The classesreferred to by an applet must be either:

<ul>
      <li>Java platform classes (such as 
        <code>java.lang.String</code>) which
	are present in a browser, or,
      <li>classes that can be downloaded from the applet's
	<code>codebase</code>.
</ul>

You cannot, and should not, expect a user of your applet to set
their <code>CLASSPATH</code>, and even if they did, their browser
might choose to ignore it.  Consequently, <code>appletviewer</code> 
now does the same thing that a browser would.

<p>
One nice thing about 1.1 <code>appletviewer</code> honoring
<code>CLASSPATH</code> was that you could grab a third party library
(say a <code>mailx.jar</code> providing some email related
functionality), place it on your <code>CLASSPATH</code> and your
applet could refer to the classes in <code>mailx.jar</code>.  In order
to get the same convenience in the Java 2 SDK, we recommend the use of 
<a href="../../guide/extensions/index.html">The
Extensions Framework</a>, which, unlike <code>CLASSPATH</code>, is a
deployment solution.  (<code>CLASSPATH</code> is only a
<i>development</i> time solution.)

</blockquote>

<a name="nonstd">
<h3>Standard vs. Non-standard Options</h3>
</a>

<blockquote>

<p>
In the Java 2 SDK tooks, some options are prefixed with <code>-X</code> whereas
others are not. In 1.1, if you needed to set the startup heap size of
the virtual machine to 10MB, you would say:

<pre>
    % java -ms10m Application
</pre>

<p>
In the Java 2 SDK, you should express the same option with a
<code>-X</code>.

<pre>
    % java -Xms10m Application
</pre>

<p>
The motivation here, as you probably guessed, is that the Java 2 SDK tools 
distinguishe between options that can apply to all virtual machines,
as opposed to options that are specific to a particular virtual
machine's implementation.  We expect all virtual machines will allow
setting a classpath, but we can't expect all virtual machines to
support initial heap size.

<p>
In the long run, as more compiler and virtual machine vendors
support the same standard options, replacing a compiler won't require
any changes to your makefiles, or replacing a virtual machine for a
server application you launched through a script will need no
modifications to the script.

<p>
Note however that for backwards compatibility, the Java 2 SDK
<code>java</code> launcher internally translates <code>-ms10m</code>
to <code>-Xms10m</code>, so you could still use the old
<code>-ms10m</code> option, but we recommend that you do use the newer
syntax.

<p>
For the current list of standard options, please type:

<pre>
    % java -help
    % javac -help
</pre>

<p>
For the current list of non-standard options, please type:

<pre>
    % java -X
    % javac -X
</pre>

<p>
A note to vendors -- this separation of command line options into
standard and non-standard ones is orthogonal to, and bears no relation
with, conformance requirements.  As stated earlier, we just hope that
users' lives will be eased in the long run if standard options 
become a de facto standard for options that makes sense.

</blockquote>

<a name="srcpath">
<h3>New Option to Search for Source Files: <code>-sourcepath</code> </h3>
</a>

<blockquote>

In 1.1, <code>javac</code> and <code>javadoc</code> would find both
source files and class files in the paths specified in the
<code>CLASSPATH</code> environment variable.  For example, suppose you
compiled <code>foo/bar/FooBar.java</code> and the class
<code>FooBar</code> relied on a <code>Helper</code> class, then javac
would attempt to find the source file <code>Helper.java</code> in your
CLASSPATH:

<pre>
    % ls /tmp/foo/bar/*.java
    /tmp/foo/bar/FooBar.java   /tmp/foo/bar/Helper.java

    <font color=red># Error because javac can't find Helper.class or Helper.java</font>
    % javac /tmp/foo/bar/FooBar.java
    /tmp/foo/bar/FooBar.java:3: Superclass foo.bar.Helper of ... not found.

    % setenv CLASSPATH /tmp

    <font color=red># Works because javac snooped in CLASSPATH for source files</font>
    % javac /tmp/foo/bar/FooBar.java
</pre>
         
In the Java 2 SDK, these tools still look in <code>CLASSPATH</code> for source
files unless the <code>-sourcepath &lt;path&gt;</code> option is 
included -- then it looks only in <code>&lt;path&gt;</code> for 
source files, and the <code>CLASSPATH</code> is not searched 
for source files:

<pre>
    % setenv CLASSPATH /tmp

    <font color=red># This still works with the Java 2 SDK: </font>
    % javac /tmp/foo/bar/FooBar.java

    <font color=red># But it doesn't work if you use -sourcepath</font>
    % javac -sourcepath . /tmp/foo/bar/FooBar.java
    /tmp/foo/bar/FooBar.java:3: Superclass foo.bar.Helper ... not found.
</pre>
