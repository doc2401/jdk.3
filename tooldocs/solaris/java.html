<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2></a>
<blockquote>
The <b>java</b> tool launches a Java application. It does this by
starting a Java runtime environment, loading a
specified class, and invoking that class's <b>main</b> method. The
method declaration must look like the following:
<pre>
    public static void main(String args[])
</pre>
The method must be declared public and static, it must not
return any value, and it must accept a String array as a
parameter. By default, the first non-option argument is the name 
of the class to be invoked. A fully-qualified class name should be used. 
If the <b>-jar</b> option is specified, the first non-option argument 
is the name of a <b>JAR</b> archive containing class and resource files 
for the application, with the startup class indicated by the
<b>Main-Class</b> manifest header.
<p>
The Java runtime searches for the startup class, and other classes
used, in three sets of locations: the bootstrap class path, the
installed extensions, and the user class path.
<p>
Non-option arguments after the class name or JAR file name are passed
to the <b>main</b> function.
</blockquote>

<a name="options">
<h2>OPTIONS</h2></a>
<blockquote>
The launcher has a set of <a href="#standard">standard options</a> that 
are supported on the current runtime environment and will be supported in 
future releases.
In addition, the current implementations of the virtual machines support 
a set of <a href="#nonstandard">non-standard options</a> options that 
are subject to change in future releases.

<h2>Standard Options</h2></a>
<blockquote>
<dl>
    <dt><b>-client</b>
        <dd>Select the Java HotSpot Client VM.  This is the default.
    <p>
    <dt><b>-server</b>
        <dd>Select the Java HotSpot Server VM.
    <p>
    <dt><b>-classpath</b> <i>classpath</i>
    <dt><b>-cp</b> <i>classpath</i>
	<dd>Specify a list of directories, JAR archives, and ZIP
	archives to search for class files. Class path entries are
	separated by colons (<b>:</b>). Specifying
	<b>-classpath</b> or <b>-cp</b> overrides any setting of the
	<b>CLASSPATH</b> environment variable.
	<p>
	If <b>-classpath</b> and <b>-cp</b> are not used and
	<b>CLASSPATH</b> is not set, the user class path consists of
	the current directory (<b><code>.</code></b>).
	<p>
	For more information on class paths, see 
	<a href=classpath.html>Setting the Class Path</a>.
    <p>
    <dt><b>-D</b><i>property</i><b>=</b><i>value</i>
	<dd>Set a system property value.
    <p>
    <a name="-jar"></a>
    <dt><b>-jar</b>
	<dd>Execute a program encapsulated in a JAR file. The first
	argument is the name of a JAR file instead of a startup
	class name. In order for this option to work, the manifest of 
        the JAR file must contain a line of the form 
        <b>Main-Class: <i>classname</i></b>. 
        Here, <i>classname</i> identifies the class having the 
        <tt>public&nbsp;static&nbsp;void&nbsp;main(String[]&nbsp;args)</tt> 
        method that serves as your application's starting point. See 
        the <a href="jar.html">Jar tool reference page</a> and 
        the Jar trail of the 
        <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/jar">Java 
        Tutorial</a> for information about working with Jar files and 
        Jar-file manifests.
        <p> 
        When you use this option, the 
        JAR file is the source of all user classes, and other user class 
        path settings are ignored. 
        <p>
        <strong>On Solaris 8</strong>, JAR files that can be run with 
        the "java -jar" option can have their execute permissions 
        set so they can be run without using "java -jar".
    <p>
    <dt><b>-verbose</b>
    <dt><b>-verbose:class</b>
	<dd>Display information about each class loaded.
    <p>
    <dt><b>-verbose:gc</b>
	<dd>Report on each garbage collection event.
    <p>
    <dt><b>-verbose:jni</b>
	<dd>Report information about use of native methods and other
	Java Native Interface activity.
    <p>
    <dt><b>-version</b>
	<dd>Display version information and exit.
    <p>
    <dt><b>-showversion</b>
	<dd>Display version information and continue.

<dl>
   <p><dt><b>-Xint</b>
        <dd>Operate in interpreted-only mode. Compilation to native code 
        is disabled, and all bytecodes are executed by the interpreter. 
        The performance benefits offered by the Java HotSpot VMs' adaptive 
        compiler will not be present in this mode.

    <p>
    <dt><b>-Xdebug</b>
        <dd>Start with the debugger enabled.   Refer to 
        <a href="jdb.html#description">jdb description</a> for more 
        details and an example.

    <p><dt><b>-Xbootclasspath:</b><i>bootclasspath</i>
	<dd>Specify a colon-separated list of directories, JAR
	archives, and ZIP archives to search for boot class files.
	These are used in place of the boot class files included in the
	Java 2 SDK. <em>Note: Applications that use this option for the 
        purpose of overriding a class in rt.jar should not be deployed 
        as doing so would contravene the Java 2 Runtime Environment 
        binary code license.</em>
    <p><dt><b>-Xbootclasspath/a:</b><i>path</i>
        <dd>Specify a colon-separated path of directires, JAR 
        archives, and ZIP archives to append to the default bootstrap 
        class path. 
    <p><dt><b>-Xbootclasspath/p:</b><i>path</i>
        <dd>Specify a colon-separated path of directires, JAR 
        archives, and ZIP archives to prepend in front of the default 
        bootstrap class path. <em>Note: Applications that use this option 
        for the purpose of overriding a class in rt.jar should not be 
        deployed as doing so would contravene the Java 2 Runtime Environment 
        binary code license.</em>
    <p>
    <dt><b>-Xfuture</b>
        <dd>Perform strict class-file format checks. For purposes of backwards 
        compatibility, the default format checks performed by the 
        Java 2 SDK's virtual machine are no stricter than 
        the checks performed by 1.1.x versions of the JDK software. The 
        <b>-Xfuture</b> flag turns on stricter class-file format checks 
        that enforce closer conformance to the class-file format 
        specification. Developers are encouraged to use this flag 
        when developing new code because the stricter checks will 
        become the default in future releases of the Java application 
        launcher.
    <p>
    <dt><b>-Xnoclassgc</b>
	<dd>Disable class garbage collection.
    <p>
    <dt><b>-Xincgc</b>
        <dd>
        Enable the incremental garbage collector. The incremental 
        garbage collector, which is off by default, will eliminate 
        occasional garbage-collection pauses during program execution. 
        However, it can lead to a roughly 10% decrease in overall 
        GC performance.
     <p> 
<a name="Xms">
    <dt><b>-Xms</b><i>n</i>
	<dd>Specify the initial size, in bytes, of the memory allocation pool. 
        This value must be a multiple of 1024 greater than 1MB. Append the 
        letter <tt>k</tt> or <tt>K</tt> to indicate kilobytes, or <tt>m</tt> 
        or <tt>M</tt> to indicate megabytes. The default value is 2MB. 
        
       Examples: 
       <blockquote><pre>
       -Xms6291456
       -Xms6144k
       -Xms6m
       </pre></blockquote>
    <p>
    <dt><b>-Xmx</b><i>n</i>
       <dd>Specify the maximum size, in bytes, of the memory allocation pool.
       This value must a multiple of 1024 greater than 2MB. Append the letter 
       <tt>k</tt> or <tt>K</tt> to indicate kilobytes, or <tt>m</tt> or 
       <tt>M</tt> to indicate megabytes. The default value is 64MB.  
       The upper limit for this value  will  be  approximately  4000m  
       on Solaris 7 and Solaris 8 SPARC  platforms and 2000m on Solaris 2.6 
       and x86 platforms,  minus  overhead amounts. Examples: 
       <blockquote><pre>
       -Xmx83886080
       -Xmx81920k
       -Xmx80m
       </pre></blockquote>
    <p>
    <dt><b>-Xss</b><i>n</i>
       <dd>Set thread stack size. Each Java thread has two stacks: one for
                         Java  code and one for C code.  This
                         option sets the maximum stack size  that
                         can  be used by C code in a thread to <i>n</i>.
                         Every thread that is spawned during  the
                         execution  of the program passed to java
                         has <i>n</i> as its C stack size.  The  default
                         units  for <i>n</i>  are bytes and <i>n</i> must 
                         be &gt; 1000 bytes.

                         To  modify  the  meaning  of <i>n</i>,  append
                         either the letter <tt>k</tt> for kilobytes or the
                         letter <tt>m</tt>  for  megabytes.   The  default
                         stack size is 512 kilobytes (<tt>-Xss512k</tt>).
    <p>
    <dt><b>-Xprof</b>
       <dd> 
       Profiles the running program, and sends profiling data to 
       standard output. This option is provided as a utility that 
       is useful in program development and is not intended to be 
       be used in production systems.
    <p>
    <dt><b>-Xrunhprof</b>[:<i>help</i>][:<i>&lt;suboption&gt;=&lt;value&gt;,...</i>]<dd>Enables cpu, heap, or monitor profiling. This option is typically 
    followed by a list of comma-separated "&lt;suboption&gt;=&lt;value&gt" 
    pairs.
    Run the command <b>java&nbsp;-Xrunhprof:help</b> to obtain a 
    list of suboptions and their default values.

    <p>
    <a name="Xrs">
    <dt><b>-Xrs</b></a>
       <dd>Reduces use of operating-system signals by the Java virtual 
       machine (JVM). This option is available beginning with J2SE 1.3.1.
       <p>
       In J2SE 1.3.0, the Shutdown Hooks facility was added to allow orderly
       shutdown of a Java application. The intent was to allow user cleanup
       code (such as closing database connections) to run at shutdown, even
       if the JVM terminates abruptly.
       <p>
       Sun's JVM catches signals to implement shutdown
       hooks for abnormal JVM termination. The JVM uses SIGHUP, SIGINT, and 
       SIGTERM to initiate the running of shutdown hooks.
       <p>
       The JVM uses a similar mechanism to implement the pre-1.2 feature of
       dumping thread stacks for debugging purposes. Sun's JVM uses SIGQUIT 
       to perform thread dumps.
       <p>
       Applications embedding the JVM frequently need to
       trap signals like SIGINT or SIGTERM, which can lead to interference 
       with the JVM's own signal handlers. To address this issue, the 
       <b>-Xrs</b> command-line option has been added
       beginning in J2SE 1.3.1. When <b>-Xrs</b> is used on Sun's JVM, 
       the signal masks for SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGHUP, and SIGQUIT are not 
       changed by the JVM, and signal handlers for these signals are not 
       installed.
       <p>
       There are two consequences of specifying <b>-Xrs</b>:
       <ul>
       <li>SIGQUIT thread dumps are not available.
       <li>User code is responsible for causing shutdown hooks to run, for
       example by calling System.exit() when the JVM is to be terminated.
       </ul>
   <dt><p><b>WARNING:</b> Flags <tt>-Xdebug</tt> and <tt>-Xint</tt>
          are mutually exclusive.  No more than one of 
          those options should be used on a <tt>java</tt> command line.
