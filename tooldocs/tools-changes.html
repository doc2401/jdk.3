This document describes some of the changes made to the tools in version 
1.3 of the Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition.  


<ul>
<p><li> The <b>javac</b> compiler has been completely re-implemented in 
version 1.3 of the Java 2 SDK.  The compiler implementation from previous 
releases of the SDK is still available as <b>oldjavac</b>.   
The new javac is faster than the old java.  
<p>
The nonstandard options, those prefixed with '-X', are no longer
supported.  In particular, the <tt>-Xdepend</tt> option is no longer available.
<p>
When searching the classpath or sourcepath, the new compiler does not follow
symbolic links.  In version 1.3, it is therefore necessary to avoid the use of
symbolic links within the directories appearing on the classpath and
sourcepath, and within their subdirectories.
<p>
When the new 1.3 compiler detects an error in a source file during a
compilation, it continues to parse the remaining source files and attempts
to identify any further errors that they may contain.  Code generation is
completely suppressed for the remainder of the compilation, however, and no
class files will be generated, even for compilation units that contain no
errors.  The old compiler in 1.2 would generate class files for any
compilation units that did not contain errors.  This resulted in less
redundant work during the repeated compilations required to identify and
correct all errors in a large program containing many files with errors.  We
hope to improve this behavior in the future.  The new compiler is
substantially faster overall, however, which should tend to offset this
somewhat.

<p><li>The reserved stack size for the Java application launcher on 
Win32 platforms (<b>java.exe</b>) has been decreased from 1 MB to 256 KB. 
This reduction of reserved stack size enables four times more threads than 
previously can exist simultaneously during runtime before getting an 
out-of-memory error.

<p><li>The <b>idltojava</b> compiler has been replaced with the 
new <a href="../guide/rmi-iiop/toJavaPortableUG.html"><b>idlj</b></a> compiler.

<p><li>The <b>Javadoc</b> tool recognizes the new <tt>@docRoot</tt> tag, and 
a new doclet for generating output in MIF format is available. 
Several important Javadoc bugs are also fixed in Javadoc 1.3.  See 
<a href=javadoc/whatsnew-1.3.html><b>What's New in Javadoc 1.3</b></a> 
for details.

<p><li>The <b>Jar</b> tool now provides for the 
<a href="../guide/jar/jar.html#JAR Index">indexing of Jar 
files</a> so that Jar-file contents can be accessed quickly and 
easily.  The new functionality is invoked with the Jar tool's 
new <tt>-i</tt> option. See the Jar tool reference pages for 
details [ <a href="../tooldocs/win32/jar.html">Win32</a> | <a href=../tooldocs/solaris/jar.html>Solaris</a> ].

<p><li>The <b>jarsigner</b> and <b>keytool</b> utilities have a new 
<tt>-provider</tt> option that can be used to specify the name of cryptographic 
service provider's master 
class file when the service provider is not listed in the security 
properties file.  See the reference pages for 
<b>jarsigner</b> [<a href=win32/jarsigner.html>Win32</a> | <a href=solaris/jarsigner.html>Solaris</a>] and <b>keytool</b> 
[<a href=win32/keytool.html>Win32</a> | <a href=solaris/keytool.html>Solaris</a>].  <b>Jarsigner</b> can now verify Netscape-signed 
Jar files.

<a name=rmic></a>
<p><li>The <b>rmic</b> tool (the Java RMI stub compiler) supports several 
new options:
<ul>
<li>The <tt>-bootclasspath</tt> option overrides the location of
        bootstrap class files.  
<li>The <tt>-extdirs</tt> option overrides the location of installed 
        extensions.  
<li>The <tt>-idl</tt> option creates IDL.  
<li>The <tt>-iiop</tt> option creates stubs for IIOP.  
<li>The <tt>-sourcepath</tt> option specifies where to find user source files.
</ul>
<code>rmic</code> now assumes the equivalent of '<tt>-d .</tt>' for the 
destination directory if the <tt>-d</tt> option isn't used.
See the <code>rmic</code> reference pages for details [ <a href=../tooldocs/win32/rmic.html>Win32</a> | <a href=../tooldocs/solaris/rmic.html>Solaris</a> ].

<a name=rmid></a>
<p><li>The <b>rmid</b> tool (the Java RMI Activation Daemon) now requires a security policy file, by default. For complete details, please refer to the 
<code>rmid</code> reference pages [ <a href=../tooldocs/win32/rmid.html>Win32</a> | <a href=../tooldocs/solaris/rmid.html>Solaris</a> ].

<p><li>Version 1.3 of the Java 2 SDK contains the new Java 2 Client Virtual 
Machine with Java HotSpot<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> technology as the default virtual machine 
for running applications and applets.  The virtual machine implementation 
from previous versions of the SDK (the Classic VM) is still 
included with the Java 2 SDK for Win32 platforms. It is not included 
with the Java 2 Runtime Environment nor with the Java 2 SDK for the 
Solaris operating environment.  On the Win32 SDK, the classic VM can be 
invoked by using the <tt>-classic</tt> 
option when launching applications and applets, as in these examples:
<blockquote>
java -classic MyApp
appletviewer -classic MyApplet.html
</blockquote>
If used, the <tt>-classic</tt> option must be the first option 
appearing in the command.  The <tt>-classic</tt> option also can be used 
to invoke the Classic VM when using other SDK tools.

<p><li>The version-related options of the <b>Java</b> application 
launcher have been modified in this release.  The 
<tt>-version</tt> option provides output in the following format:
<blockquote><pre>
java version "&lt;java.version&gt;"
&lt;java.runtime.name&gt; (build &lt;java.runtime.version&gt;)
&lt;java.vm.name&gt; (build &lt;java.vm.version&gt;, &lt;java.vm.info&gt;)
</pre></blockquote>
The parts in angular brackets, such as <tt>&lt;java.version&gt;</tt>, are 
values of the indicated system properties.  New option 
<tt>-showversion</tt> is similar to <tt>-version</tt>, except that 
it continues after displaying the version information so that it 
can be used when launching an application.
<blockquote><pre>
java -showversion MyApp
</pre></blockquote>

<p><li>The <b>javaw</b> application launcher normally launches an 
application on Win32 platforms without displaying a console window as does the 
<b>java</b> application launcher. The <b>javaw</b> launcher has been 
modified so that it will now display a window with error messages 
in the event that an application fails to launch.  Previously, 
<b>javaw</b> would not display an error dialog box when an application 
failed to launch which made it difficult to determine the cause of 
the problem.
</ul>
