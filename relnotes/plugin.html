On Windows, a separate Java 2 Runtime Environment including
Java Plug-in is installed with the SDK such that Internet
Explorer and Netscape Navigator will use this plug-in when 
encountering special HTML pages that invoke it.  On Solaris, 
you can obtain this plug-in separately. The following section 
describes how to configure your HTML pages to invoke the 
plug-in.

<h2>What is the Java Plug-in?</h2>

<blockquote>
      The <b>Java 2 Runtime Environment including Java Plug-in</b> 
      is a Sun product that is composed of two parts:  The 
      Java 2 Runtime Environment and the Java Plug-in.
<p>

      The <b>Java 2 Runtime Environment</b> is the 
      Java platform on which you can run, test and ship your own 
      applications.  It consists of the Java virtual machine, 
      the Java platform core classes, and supporting files. 
      It contains no development tools -- no compiler, debugger, 
      or other tools.  The Runtime Environment requires additional software --
      the Java Plug-in -- to enable it to run applets in a browser. 
<p>

      The <b>Java Plug-in</b> software allows Java applets and
      JavaBeans components to run in a browser using Sun's Java
      Runtime Environment, instead of the browser's default Java
      runtime.  The Java Plug-in works with Netscape Navigator and
      Microsoft Internet Explorer.  The plug-in requires special
      <code>&lt;OBJECT&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;EMBED&gt;</code> tags
      be embedded in the HTML page.   For documentation on the Java
      Plug-in, see <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/plugin">Java
      Plug-in</a> and click on "Documentation".  An extensive 
      <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/plugin/1.3/plugin.faq.html">Java 
      Plug-in FAQ</a> is available.

<a name="available"></a>
<h2>How is the Runtime Environment and Plug-in Available and Installed?</h2>
     
<blockquote>
      The <b>Java 2 Runtime Environment including Java Plug-in</b> is available
      from Sun on both Windows and Solaris:
<p>
<ul>		
  <li>The <b>Windows version</b> of the Java 2 SDK includes a
      redistributable version of the Java 2 Runtime Environment 
      including Java Plug-in, which plugs into a browser, upgrading
      the browser to the Java 2 platform. Once you install it, 
      you will see that the "Java Plug-in control panel" has been 
      added to your Windows "Start" menu under "Programs". 
<p>

  <li>The <b>Solaris version</b> is downloaded separately from the
      SDK Reference Implementation.  For more information, see Sun's
      <a href=http://java.sun.com/products/plugin/>Java Plug-in website</a>.
</ul>

      While the Java 2 Runtime Environment including Java Plug-in 
      is installed with the SDK for Windows, it is a separate product
      and is redistributable with your application, applet or 
      JavaBean components subject to the terms and conditions of 
      its software license (found in the Runtime Environment's README 
      and LICENSE files).
<p>

      Note that the SDK has its own internal, complete, non-redistributable 
      Java runtime environment in the <code>jre</code> subdirectory. 
      This is the runtime environment used by the SDK tools (javac, javadoc, 
      appletviewer, and so forth) and is not to be confused with
      the redistributable Java 2 Runtime Environment/Plug-in.

<a name="howinvoked"></a>
<h2>How is the Java Plug-in Invoked From an HTML Page?</h2>
<blockquote>

      As always, the browser's built-in Java runtime will be used when
      it encounters an <code>&lt;APPLET&gt;</code> tag.  However, once
      the plug-in is installed, it will automatically load the Java
      Runtime Environment when it hits a page with special
      <code>&lt;OBJECT&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;EMBED&gt;</code> HTML
      tags. The browser can then load Java 2 Platform-based applets from 
      this page to make full use of Java 2 Platform-based features.  For 
      details on how to configure your HTML pages to
      invoke the JRE, see the next section.
</blockquote>

<a name="modifyhtml"></a>
<h2>How to Modify HTML Pages</h2>
<blockquote>

      The plug-in requires the <code>&lt;OBJECT&gt;</code> tag enclose
      the <code>&lt;EMBED&gt;</code> tag to work in both Internet
      Explorer and Netscape Navigator. For details on how to configure
      your HTML pages to invoke the Java 2 Runtime Environemnt, go to Sun's 
      <a href=http://java.sun.com/products/plugin/>Java Plug-in
      website</a>, choose "Documentation", then "Java Plug-in HTML
      Specification".
